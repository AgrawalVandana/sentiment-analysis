"March 28, 2016","love this music app. great selection. Better than Pandora. Use it on my Samsung Phone. Not happy, however, that I cannot seem to get the app on my Samsung Smart TV. I get the Amazon Cloud app but not the Amazon Music App, (Amazon, if someone could contact me about this, would greatly appreciated) The Amazon Cloud app does not seem intergrated with the Amazon Music app.....Thanks!"
"July 30, 2017","Terrific app."
"May 23, 2017","Nice selection, I have it on a couple of devices, only problem is they're not synced together through amazon music."
"May 4, 2017","It great piece to have tons of music to choose from! Loving it!"
"June 30, 2016","Lots of product but I just didn't use it enough to justify spending over a $100 dollars a year on this. Plus they make you pay a year in advance and you can't pay monthly which sucks. Maybe if they started charging monthly I'd sign up again. The free 2 days shipping on products was goo thought. But I never watched a movie or listened to a song on Amazon."
"May 29, 2017","Music choices are great and diverse. I listen to ""Top Pop"" and would prefer a few more recent hits, but overall I'm very pleased with the service."
"October 3, 2017","Amazon Music is great , I don't know why I didn't get it sooner. love it."
"April 27, 2016","Love that you can download music as a Amazon Prime Member. Just was a little confusing for me when it asked certain questions on where to store songs and also if there was a charge for the songs. That is the only reason I did 4 stars. I am not quite as tech savy as some of the younger people, so just would have liked a little more explanation. Love having the music though."
"April 10, 2017","works great"
"August 17, 2015","In addition to the ridiculous list of things it wants access to, this app would not let me log in to my own Prime profile. It kept logging me in under my mother, even when I put my own email and password in multiple times. She doesn't have Amazon Prime or any of my music, so all the music I just saved to my library apparently is now worthless. I guess I just go back to Spotify. At least that's a lot easier to use and lets me log in to my own profile."

"June 17, 2015","This has been a great benefit of being a prime member. Its has almost infinite playlists and music geared towards everyone and everything. I love the thumb up thumbs down options that allow you to make your preferences known, plus the ability to download whole albums or just single songs. It brings up new artists you might like and has stations for whole genres or just specific artists that also play their musical colleagues. Great product or service from amazon. AGAIN!"
"October 4, 2017","Love my country!"
"October 6, 2017","Works great"
"May 10, 2017","I am really impress with the Amazon Music, I love it. HUGE selection of all kind if music of all gender. The Best Music player!! I know what I'm talking because I am a Broadcaster and DJ's."
"May 2, 2016","Just started using Amazon music but so far I am really liking it! I was easily able to find music that I liked and out it where I can listen to only what I want to listen to! Lots to choose from and I have barely begun to look! My only issue is that now my son is asking me non-stop for my phone so he can listen too! As long as he stays in my country world, all will be well!"
"June 20, 2014","Decent service. Love the fact that it's bundled w/ Prime. Makes Primes an even greater bargain! The service itself is.... useable... The music selection is not as vast as other services and the audio quality for some reason is only so-so. Love the playlists and the ability to download music for offlilne streamline those are must have for any music streaming services. Hopefully artists and content will increase with time. Impossible to give a bad review to free service to Prime subscribers but I wouldn't mind paying an extra few bucks a month if the issues noted above were addressed."
"July 23, 2017","Idk if I could live without this app!!!!"
"October 7, 2017","Cool music !!!"
"May 14, 2016","Absolutely love Amazon Prime Music..it's very easy to navigate between different music styles where you can listen or skip and save your preferences with 1 tap. They of course have updates regular to add all the newest songs"
"June 19, 2017","Tweaky, kept having to back out of the app to change stations, fiddle-y and annoying. Maybe it's better from my Chromebook, but on my phone the app was a PITA and I probably won't use it."
"May 5, 2017","works well"
"March 11, 2017","great music"
"June 13, 2017","Works well"
"November 10, 2017","Good value for prime members"
"November 20, 2013","Great songs,sound and great price. Not only all that but you earn as you buy. I earned one song of my choice for buying this cd. and the song you pick automatically just downloads to any device you want it too. OH first install this MP3 on your device. I installed it on my Android phone"
"May 22, 2017","Works great. I use it."
"July 21, 2017","I can listen anywhere to the music I've already selected. Love this!!!"
"December 2, 2016","AMAZON MUSIC is so easy and is much better than ITUNES in many ways. The only downfall is that my CHRISTIAN artists do not do as much with Amazon Music and other than that...I downgraded my ITUNES account and am doing Amazon now. We are going to buy the Echo Dot and love the whole Alexa thing...better than Siri!"
"December 20, 2016","I gave it one star because I could not give it zero. Nothing works on this system. The help desk is not useful either (although they tried), and the software is anything but user friendly. I would pass this up, along with ECHO which is the worst purchase I ever made. Do not take it even if offered for free."
"June 2, 2017","I plan to work with it a little more, but so far am not impressed. Too complex. Too many steps involved to listen to music, in spite of the emails telling me was a great offering is available to me as a Prime member. Pandora is much simpler and user friendly."
"July 15, 2017","Good music"
"September 4, 2017","Excellent"

"October 14, 2017","Very nice"
"May 15, 2017","It very good"
"May 16, 2017","I love this app"
"August 8, 2017","I can't get it to work. It keeps trying to use my UK account instead of my US prime account. Customer service was less than helpful. It's a real shame."
"July 14, 2017","I love music this is the best app"
"January 15, 2017","IF, IF, IF this were accessible by ""dial-in"", it would be GREAT. But it's not. So sorry. WHEN will all the radio and music industry EVER learn that not everybody on planet earth can afford giga bite upon giga bites to download simple music to enjoy. GO GET a life in the real world out here will ya."
"March 1, 2017","nice jams!"
"November 1, 2016","easy to use - great selection!"
"September 7, 2016","It's okay they have a pretty good music selection, that's my expense or at least with the music listen to Spotify it has more options YouTube Red has even more, but YouTube can be annoying because the videos take up a lot of space if you're saving them offline. But its nice that this comes with prime because I would get Prime anyways."
"November 6, 2015","Best thing for my morning walks with a busy baby and wild husky. I download songs at home before I leave so I don't get charged data by my wireless carrier. For the price of FREE the music selection is amazing. I have music for working out, morning walks, putting my baby to bed, studying, calming anxiety attacks, and music to get me though long road trips! As long as Amazon keeps this feature we will keep purchasing Prime!"
"May 16, 2017","Love the music."
"March 1, 2017","User friendly, good content."
"March 1, 2015","Amazon Music with Prime Music is a great addition to my prime account. It provides a very nice selection of all types of music and the ability to select individual tracks. Well done, Amazon."
"July 25, 2017","All good"
"September 13, 2017","Love it!"
"August 10, 2017","Love it!"
"July 20, 2017","love amazon music"
"September 7, 2017","Very easy to use and great selection."
"April 15, 2017","Why is this app not working at all?"
"March 2, 2017","Its Free"
"April 28, 2017","Love site"
"April 15, 2015","I started out by taking advantage of the prime 30 day free trial. I wasn't sure if I needed to subscribe to prime as I don't have a way to connect my phone to the TV to enjoy instant prime movies. I don't have a gaming device. Then as I was learning more about prime music. The rest is history, I am now a prime member. Maybe before my membership runs out I will have some kind of device to view thru my TV. Thanks again. Love Amazon and Prime Amazon. Keep up the good work"
"April 6, 2017","Pretty good availability. Not all choices available (free music)are the original musicians or versions of particular songs ,you probably can purchase them . On my laptop the Playlist is a little hard to edit ."
"June 20, 2017","good app"
"March 23, 2016","I always gave great credit to Amazon for doing its part to make Android apps available for the BlackBerry OS. No longer. I have reason to own a BB10 OS device, which does have the ability to run Android apps, but only if the vendor allows the app to be downloaded, which in this case Amazon no longer allows. I'm dumping my Amazon Prime subscription and giving the money to Spotify."
"April 30, 2017","perfect"
"June 3, 2016","My go to when I drive. I love the music selection. I was also happily surprised when I got a message last week that the new Bob Dylan was out. I promptly downloaded it. I truly dig the stations and suggested music."
"November 22, 2016","YOu can think of a lot of songs and then they are there for almost free (Prime cost). How cool is that, no CD's no tapes , no records just right there. Not all music shows up , but the majority of the time i find what i am looking for. The search could be more easier but perhaps it is my searching technique ;-)"
"November 15, 2016","Works well on my smart phone. Not comparing it to itunes or any other provider As a stand alone product, I use it with Audio CDs purchased and I can download with prime in 5 seconds. I use it daily no measure of sound quality, etc. Simply works for me. Use phone, open Amazon player, hear my music. Grateful!"
"July 19, 2017","love it"
"June 3, 2017","It's so nice!"
"March 18, 2017","Great Product"
"August 23, 2017","Quality sound without commercials and good choices. I would like to see more stations posted without having to search."
"April 21, 2017","love it"
"August 12, 2017","Great choices, works perfect on my phone"
"August 20, 2015","I can't give negative stars, or else I would. There is no reason this product needs Android beyond 2.1. The best use for a old phone or device is to put it in a corner as a music player. But this requires that you be on the most current version of Android. Useless app.  It needs far too many permissions and is a data hog. I believe that is why they want the more current Android, in order to assure they are on my current device."
"September 14, 2017","Okay just checked my drive which i just reloaded 3 days ago. On a 12gb drive per month allowance that i end up with time left, I now have 10gb left after 2&1/2 days. When you have to open apps to run other apps"
"July 9, 2015","It is lacking many features for sorting or searching for duplicates, etc. But I'm loving having such a huge library included with my Prime account. I look forward to continuing to develop the apps to have more features I'd like to see. I've tried several other streaming services and have not been satisfied at all from constantly crashing my devices to not syncing between computer and devices. Been using Prime Music for weeks now with no issues at all."

"December 16, 2013","I've used this app for nearly 2 years and it's been great. I love my Amazon cloud drive and have most of my music uploaded to the cloud drive. Unfortunately, the recent update to this app is broken. If you are listening to music and then go use another app (chrome, facebook, a game, etc.) then the music will randomly stop playing at some point. So, this app is great if you are only going to listen to music and not use your device for any other apps. I'm back to using the system music player for now. My device is a Samsung Galaxy S3.  **UPDATE**  I tried to create a new review, which doesn't work. Still only 1 star, though, since I can't give the app negative stars.  The new Amazon MP3 app is essentially unusable. You've never been able to set the download location to download music to the SD card but at least with the old Amazon MP3 app you could copy downloaded music to the SDCard. This is such a fundamentally flawed design choice that it really makes me question amazon's focus on what customer's want. However, now it's even worse with this new piece of crap app which 1) keeps defaulting to using Prime Music when you open the app (which sucks - I just want to play my music) but, 2) even worse, when you download music and copy it to the SDCard it won't see your music even if it's in the same folder. I've also found, when I did briefly use this new version of the app, that it crashed pretty regularly.  I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S4.  Oh well. At least the Google Music app continues to just work. Can I give that app a 5-star review on Amazon? ;)"
"June 4, 2017","ok app"
"September 1, 2017","Love it!!!! Move over pandora"
"March 10, 2016","Being old...I saw the birth of the 8 Track player, the cassette, then the CD, DVD, and now ""the cloud"". What will they think of next? Think I forgot about the MP3...not sure where it fits. Personally I don't have one, least not that I'm aware of. I should probably ""rent"" a little kid between say 8 and 10. They know more about this stuff than 20 adults OVER 65!"
"August 11, 2017","Works great."
"January 20, 2016","On a small device it is hard to navigate. It also does not remember what you did the last time you were on, so you have to repeat everything. Sometimes slow to load and buffering issues, but that may also be the fault of my provider. Overall it's good."
"October 19, 2016","Prime member ... For now. But renewal is due soon. Can not download music app. Can not listen to my Amazon music. Don't care about audible or free books. Amazon is slipping, no star deserved."
"March 19, 2017","good"
"May 3, 2017","love"
"September 27, 2015","AZ keeps adding more reasons to use Prime. This is one of them. Lots of music to hear for free on a variety of devices. Come for the shipping, stay for the music and movies!"
"October 30, 2017","I like"
"June 23, 2014","Much like the prime video selection the prime music selection is small and includes mostly older music. While it generally works OK for the music it does have I was unable to find any way to just search the music that is available through prime music and not for purchase on the amazon store so almost every time I went to listen to a song it was going to charge me.  If you were able to limit the search and list of songs to only those available for free I would have given it a higher score but at the moment it was a lot more frustration than listening pleasure."
"June 11, 2017","Nice"
"April 16, 2017","Good"
"June 1, 2017","Love"
"March 13, 2017","great"
"August 30, 2017","great service all kinds of music. would be great if it had a voice recognition to search for music while you drive"
"November 1, 2016","Great music available!"
"March 20, 2017","good"
"April 7, 2016","It used to work great until the OS update. I hope they fix it soon. The update makes the app useless."
"July 23, 2017","Fun"
"June 11, 2016","Crashes my Android often and chews data like crazy. Very counter-intuitive to install on a second device (the amount of hunting I'm having to do to conduct a simple operation like install on a PC is insane)."
"September 20, 2013","I'm loving using my SamsungS3 phone with Amazon MP3 app + RunDouble's C25K app. It's great to be able to add new songs to my training play list without having to doc to my PC; keeps my training runs fresh.  Finally time to retire my iPod Shuffle and the original C25K podcasts."
"October 10, 2017","Love Amazon music"
"February 20, 2015","I have tried over & over again to get this app to open on my phone. I keep getting an Account Error ""Exception #45"". I have reported the problem & get no reply from Amazon customer service."
"May 3, 2017","AT A PRESENT TIME MY NUMBER ONE SUPPLIER."
"January 9, 2013","I love the Amazon Cloud service, and I store my entire music library on it. Unfortunately, my experience with it has been inconsistent and disappointing. I have an iPhone, and if I use the app on there for more than about 5 minutes, it locks up my phone, and it can take a full minute for it to respond. I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab, and for some reason, Amazon decided to eliminate the ability to browse my library by genre. That might not seem like a big deal for some people, but it's huge for me. Really makes the app useless unless I know exactly what I want to listen to. I realize there are competition issues between Amazon and Apple, and Amazon and Google, but these inconsistencies and poor performance is a real let-down from Amazon."
"March 18, 2016","This app works great... Until it crashes. Usually it has to shut down a couple times a week. I like the music on Amazon Prime so I deal with it. But I like to let my phone stream through my car audio system. So when it crashes that means no more good Amazon Prime music. When it works I am very pleased though. When it doesn't, well I always keep a CD in the player as back up."
"November 6, 2016","Excellent product as advertized"
"July 18, 2017","Ok"
"December 18, 2015","Love the application, though I grant only 3, because by mistake I deleted the mp3 folder for the music included with prime, and the application didn't give me the opportunity to download them again, so no off-line library at the moment because of that, the stations is awesome because it's like have a lot of radio stations without commercial breaks and dumb comments every now and then.. just music 24/7"
"May 21, 2017","Decent"
"June 15, 2014","Get free music from a service that you already pay for. How can you not like it!! The selection is a little scarce, but it's new, so I'm sure the selection will increase in time. Seems that Amazon would put more effort in their prime video service (which is still very limited and lacks the selection of their competitors) instead of launching additional services. Just seems a little backwards to me, but I won't complain about something free!!"
"July 3, 2014","For all of us that have been using Amazon MP3 since the first Android devices came out, this is a major disappointment. First you snub us with instant video, then you take away tablet support for music and replace it with a beta quality. This after we have already spent significant money buying music from you. Sure i can switch to a new service, but i really had no plans too before this, and really did not want to spend the time. Its hard to understand what your issue is with Android, i am positive that you could develop whatever you want. I wish you would have never showed up on Android, that way I could have built a library on another service to begin with. Very dissapointed. Will have to use the pre-installed version until i can switch my wife and i to something else. Who would have guessed a pre-installed app would come in handy. Good luck with your new fire products. Looks like i will be buying stock in the first amazon alternative that comes along, cause this alienation of such a large customer base makes no business since whatsoever. You are trying to crush Google, but pushing people to them. You could have owned the entire android ecosystem pretty much with prime music and video and apps."
"June 17, 2015","I don't know what the core problem is, but I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 (AT&T) and I have another app that can track things like when apps restart multiple times, consuming resources like RAM memory, response time, and temperature, and for whatever reason, this and all the other Amazon apps have periods where they'll restart anywhere from 5 to 47 times in a 5 minute period. Amazon, you gotta fix this, it's not right to be slowing down a competitor's product."
"March 15, 2017","Liked it better before changes."
"March 3, 2017","I adore this app. It is great !"
"May 15, 2015","The app only works once per install on my 2nd Gen Moto X running lollipop. After a reboot the app consistently reports that my library is empty until I uninstall and reinstall. I'm not a novice user. I've checked my authorization limit. I've even reset my phone to factory defaults. Nothing fixes this app. The fact that this problem has existed for months now shows that Amazon is not committed to maintaining this app and therefore not maintaining their music service."
"August 31, 2017","Love this app! Tons of music. Easy to navigate around. 5 stars!"
"February 5, 2017","Great app for prime music"
"June 25, 2016","Amazon music is awesome! Since I am a prime member, I have free access to all kinds of great music. If you don't have amazon prime you should get it. The free shipping and music is definitely worth it!"
"August 29, 2014","Although, I must admit the number of albums seems quite astonishing, I'm not satisfied for a few reasons. First and foremost: their marketing and cheap gimmick tactics to increase member subscriptions. Signing up for a free trial membership is usually something I'm wary about, but I took the bait this time and low and behold, after one month of use, I was charged a YEAR subscription renewal fee! Most companies will just charge for the next month and that seems reasonable, but surely this is a ploy to increase revenues and artificially inflate membership while skirting customer satisfaction because at the end of the day they bank on folks like myself simply forgetting to cancel their 'free' trial membership. Numero dos: while the music I've listened to has been great, and I enjoy their offline access to albums, they do not have any of the simple user-friendly displays like some other music counterparts (Spotify, Pandora, Grooveshark, etc. etc.). If you're listening on a web browser, it's constantly being opened into new tabs and nothing is intuitive. Also, with no filter to search prime music (when clicking on other music that might interest you) could lead to folks accidentally purchasing products they thought were free. Number three: after resigning to the fact that I purchased this membership, I tried to watch some programs on my tablet and low and behold! Does not work with most Android products. Or Chromecast (to my knowledge). Now that I've purchased the year subscription, I'll certainly give this a shot. But fool me once Amazon, shame on you. You have one year to win me back."
"June 27, 2017","eewf"
"August 2, 2014","Unlike others, I don't want to download all my music onto my phone. That would be impossible! I own a LOT of music, and when this app was Amazon MP3, I was easily convinced that I should upload all of my digital music to Amazon, and then I could play it wfrom my phone where ever I was (as long as I had a good internet connection, of course). Got a new phone, and I downloaded the new Amazon Music app. What it shows as 'Cloud' music is only about 1% of the music I store on Amazon's cloud servers. I can't really review any other feature of the app, because my music is not accessible. I called Amazon, and was told they were working on it. A couple of days later there was an update, which did not fix this problem. Amazon can add all the features it wants, but if I cannot play the music I already own, the app is useless to me."
"March 25, 2017","A++"
"January 5, 2017","Some songs to download you have to buy , so again whats the point of been a prime member ? Amazon is trying to squeeze every cents out of us.🤔💱"
"August 5, 2017","Love it"
"April 28, 2016","If you have prime, use this! My musical tastes are vast. If you sometimes vary far off the beaten path your needs will be met and expanded.  So very satisfied... nothing is quite as good as being introduced to music you may like and having them hit the nail on the head.  Just make sure you are on wifi when you hit a pocket of awesome tunes."
"April 29, 2017","One of the best music channels out there!!! Thank you Amazon!!"
"May 15, 2017","fantastic"
"April 23, 2015","I love Amazon Prime and now they have added Prime Music, I like it for the most part - there are a lot of popular songs and some new songs that I get to listen for Free. I took one star away because, like I said before - - it's only POPULAR music. I live in Hawaii and I love it when streaming sites let me listen to my own local music. Granted they have like old Hawaiian Slack Key music, but I'm more interested in local Jawaiian music that plays locally over the radio."
"January 29, 2016","I don't understand the negative comments. There is a ton of free music for Prime members. Easy to access and easy to play. And I am a grandma :)"
"October 19, 2015","I wish I could download purchased music directly to my phone. Instead I have to go through this disgusting app Amazon is stuffing down my throat."
"December 5, 2015","A great app to use on my android phone and tablet! I love that I can upload my personal library to it and listen to it when I'm on other devices then my computer."
"November 6, 2017","The music / mantras that I like to listen to are on Amazon Unlimited of which I have to pay for. It's o $2 less than Google Music which isn't much of a difference so decided to keep Google Music. Mainly, I don't want to have to go through and reset playlists also."
"December 31, 2015","I love this app. I am still learning and navigating my way through but it is the only music app I use now! It has a lot to offer!"
"May 29, 2017","It's awesome to be able to take my music anywhere!!"
"March 15, 2017","Wonderful selections, great sound....fantastic Prime benefit."
"September 25, 2016","Solid app for music streaming and downloading. The best part is that there are constant updated virtual stations and playlist that are spot on. One of my most used apps."
"January 31, 2016","It asked me when I first tried to download where I want music stored. I chose sd card and that's where they're being stored. Anyone having difficulties may be using an earlier version. May want to uninstall and reinstall to see if that will help."
"September 5, 2015","Huge 3dg and staind fan! From the second I listened to it I could hear bits and pieces of them but this is not those bands! This is much harder than 3dg and more composed then staind. I haven't bought an album in 5 years...this was worthy enough to buy and it's been on repeat since I got it! Incredible band and I'm stoked on their music! If you like hard rock with small amounts of metal and insanely good lyrics...buy this album!"
"August 9, 2015","I just love Amazon Music w/ Prime Music. Can't wait to see what the future holds."
"April 29, 2017","Great its part of Prime"
"April 30, 2015","I loved this at first. I was excites thinking FINALLY something better than Pandora! But day one songs stopped half way through to load like there was a connection issue each time I left home. I was using 4G so I don't get that. since then, it's happening more and more frequently. Whether I'm home or not, on Wi-Fi or 4G. Still keeps stopping mid-song to either load or the app just crashes altogether. It has potential but I'm disappointed I had to go back to Pandora."
"June 18, 2016","Its a decent bonus, but its no replacement for anybof my other music apps. The 1st 3 songs I tried to find werent in the collection, and the app doesn't play well withy android platform. I deleted it."
"June 18, 2014","This was a forced update that if you uninstall it, it removes your amazon app completely. I lost all of my playlists, and there are a lot more steps to get to the song or album you want. Too many drop down menus, and too may ads. And I don't know if this has anything to do with it but my 'desktop' screen has changed and now I have multiple pages to move thru to find what I want. Hopefully I can take it to verizon and they can reset it."
"October 23, 2017","Great!"
"April 30, 2017","This is my favorite music app and I have it on my Fire TV, Fire Tablet and Android Phone. Recent updates to this app on my Android Phone had me wondering why some of my music was missing, particularly music that I purchased and songs selected for my various playlists. The Amazon Music App updates did not negatively affect my playlists on my Fire TV or Fire Tablet. I discovered that it was Google Play and not Amazon that changed my playlists and eliminated some of my favorite songs. I had to go into Google Play and uninstall and disable the Amazon Music app, so it could only be downloaded from the Amazon web site. There were many negative reviews of this app on the Google Play site and now I realize it is because of the changes that Google Play makes to the app on installation and updates. The Amazon Music app will not properly function when downloaded by Google Play. When I installed this app again from the Amazon web site, it was perfect in form and function. No stalling and stopping and no missing songs."
"December 31, 2016","Let's face it Amazon can't do everything just yet but we'll on their way. I listen to non mainstream music and they just don't have it quite yet"
"October 14, 2016","Doesn't work on a note 7"
"March 30, 2015","I should have know Amazon Prime (Music/Kindle/Video) was too good to be true! Like Netflix, RedBox and any of the others like it, there are always loopholes/limitations. Every movie, song, book I've tried to download, it wasn't included in the Prime package. I can just as easily wait for the book to come out at my local library and read it for free. The same applies to music/videos. Looks like the only thing that I'm going to benefit from by purchasing Prime is the free shipping for my Christmas shopping."
"July 21, 2017","Love it!!"
"August 12, 2014","We have tried using this on several different devices thinking that maybe that the app was just not working with the device (yes, we know only 1 device at time). However, the shuffle doesn't really 'shuffle', the music will just stop without notice, and the Prime music to the computer and the Prime music to the device do not sync.  Since this is still a new feature, we will be holding out to see how it adapts."
"March 6, 2017","I am enjoying my music"
"May 5, 2017","Good"
"October 5, 2016","This even beats itunes! You can get an artist or song with their search!"
"October 26, 2016","When I started looking at what was available it was like a time machine. There was my musical youth. I've found most of the albums I wore out in the 60's and 70's. All available to download into my tab and they're free with Amazon Prime. Move over iTunes there's a new and better alternative. Can't beat Free."
"January 15, 2016","I rate Amazon Music app higher than its two top-rated competitors' apps -- Google Play Music and Audials. Brilliantly designed user interface that is easy to use and navigate. Immense library of music. Also, Amazon Music app works great on Fire tablets and real Android devices, such as Samsung mobile devices. Amazon nailed it dead-on with its music app. Woot, Woot, Woot for Amazon!"
"January 1, 2017","Very cool, but there's no way to delete duplicate songs without having to delete all of the copies of the song instead of just the extra ones."
"July 2, 2014","Works quite well but I must periodically log back into Amazon when the music stops and asks me to do so. Why's that? 04.11.17 Won't open now. Why's that? Amazon Customer Service took care of the problem. Wonderful!"
"October 28, 2017","Too expensive"
"January 6, 2017","Since the last update I can't get the app to work on my PC at all. The app slows to a death march speed. I have removed it from my system."
"September 24, 2016","It is doesn't have every song of every musician out there which kind of sucks. However, I do like the prime station and I like that I can add a song to make my own playlist. The other down side to this though is that when you listen to a prime station you can't go back to see what the previous songs and artist are."
"February 28, 2017","Love it"
"April 13, 2016","If I could give this app negative stars, I would.  I have been a longtime Amazon customer (since the '90's). When the Amazon MP3 app came out, it was great. There were free daily MP3's, and I bought quite a bit of music from my phone. Then in updates it would become sluggish, but then you'd get a new (Android) phone and it would be okay. But then there was the change to Amazon Music, and the authentication scheme Amazon came up with for this would then break my login in other Amazon apps (Shopping and Kindle). It became unusable on my last phone. When I got my current phone I tried it again, and it worked for maybe a month, before it suddenly decided that my phone had been registered to someone else and I could not access my cloud library or Prime Music.  Amazon Customer Support for this is pretty much non-existent--they will only talk to you on the phone, and then they'll tell you to wipe your phone and start over reinstalling EVERYTHING, which is ridiculous.  I recently tried the app again, and it was miraculously working for no obvious reason (though the Kindle app would then keep asking me to re-login), but with this most recent update it is now once again broken for me--it gives me a network error, so I tried reverting to my backup of the previous version, and guess what, it now says that my phone was registered to someone else and I can't access my cloud library or Prime Music.  So, I give up Amazon. I've bought a ton of crap from you, and I would probably buy a lot more music from you if I could buy it on my phone and be an even happier Prime customer if I could listen to Prime Music on my phone, but this app is a total disaster and the biggest black mark on my otherwise sterling opinion of your company. The shopping and Kindle apps work great, Music works great on my iPad (and Kindle Fire and Fire TV), so I don't know what your problem is."
"September 10, 2014","It's a great app and with Prime Music it became even better. I really wish if I could get access to Prime Music even when I'm not in the US, that's definitely would make it the best music streaming app ever.  I contacted Amazon Customers Service and asked them about playing music through Prime Music outside the US.They told me that I must have a credit card issued in the USA in my Amazon account to be able to listen to Prime Music even when not in the US.  I have deleted the US credit card and that what caused the problem."
"November 27, 2016","I dislike the updated user interface. wish it was more seamlessly integrated into my Toyota in dash audio system. otherwise very very happy user."
"May 11, 2017","It works"
"January 21, 2016","Have used it ""on the go"". Works great, choice is vast, service is clear and... well, I use it a lot."
"May 25, 2017","Great app, lots of good tunes. So much available for free to prime members!"
"September 30, 2017","good music"
"May 17, 2017","so far so good!"
"July 1, 2014","I have tried downloading it my 3 units Desk top is OK but does not let me access all my playlists  My Android only seem to have some of the Albums but mostly singles from the albums listed  My note pad I installed it, then I had a problem so I deleted it now it tells me I already have it loaded but I cannot find the icon to reinstall it  All you seem to want is for me to purchase more music though prime, when I can't play the music I already have loaded"
"June 14, 2017","Greatest thing ever"
"August 24, 2017","It's an alright music streaming service. My only issue is that its crazy how for Amazon to have all these options such as kindle, echo, music, prime, etc. they can't seem to keep up with the updated payment information for one Amazon account. It makes no sense to me AT ALL."
"June 22, 2016","It's improved now that my phone can control all music and can manage the equalizer without an in app setting but there are still intermittent pauses or breaks in music every so often. But overall I like this app a lot."
"July 21, 2015","1) When you but a digital album you should be able to download in 1 or 2 clicks. Amazon forces you to load the app, wait for the library to update (which takes some time), find it in the library, then download it. If the internet were ubiquitous, I would not need to download. But since it isn't I download first. Please don't make this so hard.  2) Each time I buy something, I am prompted to download the app (with a pop us that really pushes you to download the app). I already have the app, so quit confusing me."
"September 6, 2017","Selection is good for the type of music i prefer Easy to search and download"
"November 23, 2015","Ugh, constant issues with the app not working. I receive an error code on many songs. Reinstall the app, have to reset up all playlists, redownload mp3s, clear cache, etc. and still it tanks. Now I can't even get it to download my purchase album- uuuuggggghhhhhh!!!!!! I wish it would work as intended, as Prime Music is a great perk assuming we can actually use it as intended."
"March 14, 2017","great work"
"June 14, 2016","good"
"June 15, 2017","Pretty awesome access to tons of music included with my Prime membership."
"April 19, 2015","Very obtuse, difficult to navigate and select genre which are very limited. I had an even harder time with it on my phone. It also says you can ""download"" music if you are a Prime member but I haven't figured out how to do it without paying for the songs. If it is possible that is fine but it apparently isn't user friendly."
"January 8, 2017","Incredibly good service"
"August 23, 2016","I use this all the time. I have the app on my phone so I can take it with me every where I go. I have found sooo much music from ""back in the day"" that I thought I'd never hear again. It's much better than listening to the radio...no commercials! It made all my other music apps obsolete...just plain love it!"
"October 17, 2016","I used to use Amazon music with my Prime account. Now Amazon won't install on my phone, so I can't. Until it gets fixed I can't give it more than one star."
"August 21, 2016","I love being able to stream music free on my phone with the app. This is a great perk for amazon prime members!  We stream at home and hook my phone to a cord that runs through the stereo and surround speakers so I can listen while cooking. I also do this in the car.  I love all the chanel's offered."
"July 29, 2014","When I use with Bluetooth in car the displayed data is missing artist. I can see track and album but artist data missing. This only happens with Amazon music. Google, songza, milk, Pandora, Spotify all display complete data"
"February 16, 2016","The 500 song limit is cheesy, the radom function is not! Program runs extremely slow when adding songs to playlist"
"November 4, 2015","I'm pleased with Amazon Prime Music on my desktop and Android devices, but I'm not pleased with the Amazon Cloud Player on my Samsung Smart TV. The Cloud Player has limited functionality and will not play Amazon Prime music (it will only play my music).  Unfortunately 90% of my use of Amazon Prime Music would be via my Samsung Smart TV. Therefore I'm back to Pandora and other apps on the TV."
"January 14, 2017","Great app, has plenty of music."
"September 22, 2017","Awful! Clunky and not intuitive. I expected way more from Amazon."
"March 14, 2017","The music should be free with the prime membership."
"September 26, 2015","I have this on my HTC one M8 and it crashes every few minutes. I've used it in the past with no issues but with this HTC one M8 it crashes and then wants me to send a report. Every time this happens it shuts does whatever other program i am using. GAAAA! HEEEEEEELLLLP!!!  YES I have tried updating (doesn't help) YES I have tried to install/re-install (its factory so there is no total uninstall)"
"July 4, 2014","I am a prime member and looking forward to listening to Prime music in addition to the music I bought. This app crashed and did some bad things to my Samsung Galaxy S4 tablet. This app does not work.i do not recommend this app."
"April 6, 2016","For prime members, this comes with a lot of music free of charge to stream to your phones and devices. I was surprised that there is a pretty good selection of current hit music that is included for free with prime. I primarily use it for the free music and free Hit Playlists. Also allows for caching music to phone/tablet memory or external memory card."
"January 17, 2016","Gotta love the music! Kinda sad that songs I consider my favorites, that really shouldn't be rare or hard to find, are amiss from this app... oh well, the pros must definitely outweigh the cons."
"December 8, 2014","The Good: prime members get a lot of free music, buying song is easy, the quality is also very good, like the addition of the lyrics.  The Bad: sometimes it crashes, I can't edit playlist without interrupting the music, and I saw that the app drains a lot of battery comparing with other music players. And is a little confusing at first when trying to organize your music.  I still gave a 4 star cause of the free music for prime members. Is it wasn't for that I'll give it a 3."
"October 4, 2014","Amazon Prime Music is a good services for digital downloads. The Lady Gaga Artpop album I bought was half the price of Google Play app. I also noticed that Google Play matched the price when I went back to compare their price. However, Amazon Prime gift cards in the stores start at $25. ""Whew"", "" Wow""! It's a high price to pay for one album if that's all you need. I don't have a credit card and am on a limited income. What happened to the days of the $10 iTunes card? Overall though it's quite good!"
"January 12, 2016","This app gives you access to all of the music that Amazon has. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you get accessed to free music that you can even download top you're devices. There are stations recommended for you & playlists you can create by adding music to your library. It's definitely my new go-to for music. It's like combining Pandora & an MP3 player. Best of birth worlds!"
"November 5, 2014","Can't download just to my normal music files. Have to have extra app just to listen and had to pay to do that when I already pay for prime. Too costly for just streaming basically......."
"August 1, 2017","Easy to use. Great to have access just about everywhere."
"March 16, 2017","I enjoy it"
"March 11, 2017","Excellent results."
"July 4, 2016","I was so happy to be able to have an offline mode to listen to the music."
"March 3, 2016","I LOVE Amazon Prime Music! It is a great benefit to have included in my Amazon Prime membership. That is one of the main reasons I got my membership. I like being able to listen to the music I have picked on my phone via bluetooth in my car. I can switch it to the Offline Library so it does not charge me data to listen to my music. I would not be without it!"
"January 19, 2017","It's the best one there is!"
"June 17, 2014","I have Amazon Prime, but the app would never give me the option to sign in. Also the music downloader wouldn't work in chrome on my PC and even the music I took the time to put in the cloud would not show up in the app. I deleted because it would not work on my device. LG G2. I feel like it might have been a good app if I could have gotten it to work right, just based on what I saw. This is the first app I've had trouble with."
"October 16, 2017","I love being able to create my own playlists."
"October 1, 2017","Outstanding"
"July 26, 2015","Use it on my phone to have music in the background anytime. Great elections."
"March 20, 2017","Love it"
"July 21, 2014","I love amazon Prime Music. The only reason why I give it four stars is because I can't access it on my other devices and also not with our Fire TV device."
"July 7, 2016","If you subscribe to any other music service and video service like Netflix or Hulu you're going to kick yourself for the price of commercial free Hulu you can get Amazon Prime which includes all the music you can download or stream all the movies you can watch and free Amazon 2 day shipping all for one low price. Fantastic deal"
"October 7, 2017","I love it!"
"December 25, 2016","the worst app for moving music i have ever seen, im fan of amazon and using alexa with amazon echo a lot, but this app is something out of ordinary, you realy have to make an effort to design app so poor. what i think most people will use this all with their amazon prime subscription is upload music and then listen to echo when needed... but whole process is so slow and complicated, its not even worth using it. after few hours of trying to upload, i only managed to made my Echo play 10-20 of my music, out of 100s i tried to upload. whole process is designed to be worst possible user friendly one. i think only person who will understand whats going is the guy who wrote the program. realy hoped that thery will change interface of do something with this app. but 5 months passed and nothing.  realy disappointed with amazon.... as said in the beguiling im real fan and admirer of whole amazon chain but this is just CRAP!!!"
"October 16, 2017","Good music"
"August 18, 2014","I like what Amazon is planning on doing with Prime Music, however the selection is still scarce. Secondly it feels like, with Prime Music, they (Amazon) still want you to purchase music. If you like buying albums of a whole artist go you'll like this, but if you like to pick and choose go with Spotify instead. Also, if you like finding obscure, less known or independent artists on Amazon you're going to run into problems. Seriously, at $10 dollars a month ( $5 for students first time) Spotify is a far superior product."
"November 9, 2016","Love this app. It has so many features."
"December 29, 2016","It was nice having a large selection of free music with my Prime membership, but latest update seems to have taken a lot of that away. As if the Prime membership fee is not enough, you now want me to pay a subscription to listen to music that was once inluded with Prime! Guess you need to be more like the competitors and nickle and dime your customers at every turn!"
"September 7, 2014","I'm a Spotify user, having used Rhapsody for years before that. I don't buy my music to listen to. Given that, let's just say that Amazon Prime's new music addition is really next to worthless. As most of us Prime members have come to realize, the number of products covered by the Prime membership increasingly smaller and is always in flux, at its best. In some cases, it's almost laughable. Now Amazon want to tell us they've added value to the membership by featuring these incidental cuts from a tiny minority of albums that one can hear for ""free."" Not to mention one needs their Amazon Music with Prime Music app! This is largely a piece of trash. Try getting it off your device once you've installed it! Surprise, it's part and parcel of the increasingly restrictive OS of the Kindle Fire now (don't know about others). What's more, there's no way to opt out of its constantly being loaded into memory.  Come on Amazon, isn't it time that you give your Prime customers some credit for choosing Prime? MUST we make _exclusive_ use of every product you offer us as members? It's becoming much more an indentured servitude than a perks membership. Even more, with every product you become more restrictive than before. Do you consider us mindless fools? Really? Gee thanks."
"July 12, 2014","This has not went well for me. Keep getting prompts to download current adobe flash player, already have it. Try to download music importer app, error #5020 'Not connected to net"" odd, since I am. Contacted amazon, waited a day to hear back, then they called me, no help. I waited all day for a call back, no help. She told me to contact my anti-virus company, I have AVG, and I have allowed adobe and importer to download. She said she would call back today, have not heard from them. It's a shame because of the amount of music available."
"November 7, 2016","page does not open, see dog pic,s - not as easy as the first version a couple of years ago - makes want to go back to pandora or google tunes -"
"September 5, 2017","Love the selection of music. Amazon Music is my best friend. It's with me where ever I go."
"December 14, 2014","I usually like to control my music and have copies in folders etc, but Amazon Music is such a complete system, when you have prime, I have been moving to it. Thanks Amazon."
"July 9, 2015","Streaming works great with the echo of my own library. I don't have prime as a buyer but rather an affiliate because my daughter added me, but I would guess it would be as good a streaming experience as my own library which has the limit of 250 songs in the Amazon Cloud in it plus the ability to add the songs to your library. I haven't a single complaint when it comes to Amazon. They do business the way a business should be run."
"November 10, 2014","Regularly crashes and gives errors, I've talked to tech support numerous times, each time it appears to be better for a couple days and goes back to being horribly glitchy and unwieldy. Sometimes I'll play a song from my device, not even on the cloud, and it will take 10 minutes to load. Other times, I'll open it and it will immediately crash about 50 times until I can finally start to use it. I've had this for about a year and had to uninstall/reinstall it probably 30 times because of issues."
"April 5, 2016","You have to pay for almost all the music pointless just get Spotify cheaper and has more music"
"July 18, 2017","Love it! No problems with the app, & always easy to find my tunes."
"February 28, 2017","Doesn't work with Nougat."
"July 19, 2017","If your a prime member, there's no reason not to use music. No interruptions, all kinds of choices. A must!"
"September 12, 2016","love being able to select many songs that I like and have them played when I want....dissapointed that many artists are not available like Michael Jackson"
"February 12, 2017","An awesome that provides me with all i need in music"
"August 30, 2017","Lot of music, good quality. Desktop app is nice. But can't cast to chrome cast, and not as user friendly when it comes to offline stuff like Spotify."
"May 1, 2017","I love my music on my phone while work outside."
"March 14, 2016","Music is easy to save to computer or device. When I downloaded it to hard drive it went to iTunes."
"May 27, 2015","I use this to run with. Only problem is everything I log on I have nothing in my library. I have to sign out, sign back in, and redownload the songs in my playlist. Then as soon as I disconnect from WiFi it loses my songs again and I have to pause my workout and do the same process over again. Very updating bug."
"December 1, 2015","I bought 30 songs which can only be downloaded to cloud. Spent hours over many days on the phone with Amazon to try to get it into my library on my Galaxy S6. Told me theyou would call me back. Never did and won't answer my emails. The offered me $4 credit for my next song purchase. Yes, $4 on $45 worth of songs that I canr hear in my library. No more buying songs from Amazon for me."
"June 25, 2016","Who needs another worthless waste of space & RAM app?"
"June 5, 2015","CLUNKY! Yes, it does the trick, but sometimes I get confused as to where to look for things. Want to see albums by a certain artist? OK, you can do that, but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. Let's say you're not all that familiar with an artist but want to download or buy their latest album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy, also!  It's also buggy. Several times, I've been told that my Prime tracks have been 100% downloaded. Then, when I'm on the road with no available wifi, the tracks are not listed under my Offline tracks- only under my Cloud tracks! This has happened on more than a couple occasions.  Also, when I'm listening to Amazon music and doing other things on my phone such as web browsing, Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background- and this is on a 2014 Moto X, not some ancient smartphone.  The interface is just not friendly at all. If I wasn't already paying for Prime, I'd switch back to Spotify in a heartbeat (not that its UI is that much better, but its selection of subscription-based music definitely is)."
"August 25, 2014","I have used this app for a couple of years and had no problems with the app till the last upgrade a couple of months ago when the app refused to work on my galaxy s3 after a couple of calls with Amazon Tec support a solution came no closer. I have since upgrade my phone and low and behold all of the Amazon apps work once again. I find the lack of resolve on Amazon tec support rather troubling. All though I was promised to be kept in the loop I never was, not that it matters much anymore since I have a different phone"
"December 12, 2016","This app sucks. I read there is not a charge it's free. Ya right until you try to download a song. I wanted to download three or four Christmas songs for our song box to make our lights dance. It's not like I'm trying to create a music collection or something!!!!!!!!! Gee wiz"
"October 12, 2017","Would be nice if it had a bigger library of songs, but download/offline mode is a great option to save data!"
"December 27, 2014","If you don't see an Amazon Prime Membership paying off, just for the free two day shipping alone, then Do It For The Music!! You will Never have a lack of music that you love, no matter what style, genre, or artist. It's All Here!! And, that's not even mentioning what's available if you have Amazon Fire TV Boxes, or Amazon Fire TV Stick!! At $99.00 per year, that comes out to $8.25 per month!! You can finally say Goodbye to Cable TV, Satellite TV, etc........FOREVER!!! I Did!!"
"July 21, 2016","I absolutely love the large variety of music but my concern is that the app runs all the time. Even if I force close the app down it randomly start running without opening it"
"January 25, 2016","I am very impressed with the selection and the quality or music! I have just started using this service, but from what I can tell---it is absolutely top notch! An endless selection of artists stations as well. Great job Amazon!"
"October 2, 2016","I like it. Wish there were more choices. The selection is limited"
"January 2, 2015","The absolute worst streaming music app I have ever used. It constantly stops streaming regardless of the device I am using to listen to music. This happens on any network when I attempt to use the device. It even stops on my Kindle. You would think it if was going to work, the best option would be on the Kindle but nope. I have no problems with Spotify or Pandora ever stopping. If I wasn't a Prime member, there is no way I would ever use this completely useless services."
"January 7, 2017","Ok"
"September 30, 2016","Love using this app with my prime membership. Amazon has the best play lists and stations and my music sounds so much better with this app than others."
"January 24, 2017","Damn good app"

"January 28, 2017","I use this app all the time. Unfortunately, it can not be used safely while driving. On my Kia Optima it will not change songs by pushing the up or down on the steering wheel. A voice command/ Alexa style function would be nice for searching for songs while driving."
"January 24, 2017","I really enjoy the Amazon music app. With the auto-rip feature from Amazon, you get free digital copies of your music on Amazon Music. I also enjoy that I can download songs to listen offline, and that I use SD card storage. Easy to use and very convenient. Would recommend it."
"March 25, 2017","very satisfied with this product"
"December 8, 2015","Love the free music on my pc. Even got it to stream to my Ouya to listen on the surround sound in the living room"
"July 29, 2015","When I first started this membership, I was skeptical with the service. 2 day delivery, free prime music, free prime movies. But boy was I blown away! My wife and I enjoy the Fast and Speedy delivery! When they say ""Guaranteed in 2 days"" THEY MEAN IT! The free prime music and movies are better than what I bargained for and for what I paid with that 1 time payment, you will see you get Soo much more! I'm just regular guy from NY that found this membership to be a great deal!"
"May 29, 2015","A nice bonus to Prime. Now I not only get priority shipping, I have my favorite music, for any occasion, with me on the go, at home or on the road."
"December 12, 2013","I loved it, then there was an ""upgrade"" that broke everything... my main pain was losing lock screen controls, and shuffled lists... Well, finaly in update #3 or #4, the stuff is back! Amazon MP3 on my Android is usable again! I know if I had blue tooth radio, I could do without it, but as I do not - I depend on an easy way to skip a track - without unlocking the phone. I almost wish there were ""hot zones"" active if the phone is dark.. but whayt is there, is better than nothing, as was the case till few weeks ago! Not 5 stars, as the app could be better, and changes break it from time to time.. but certainly back to 4 stars!"
"January 8, 2016","For some reason the music buffers even when not streaming from the cloud. Also, it doesn't transition quickly from song to song. There have been many times that I thought my Playlist had ended, but it was just silent due to switching to another song. There is a decent amount of free music. I'm not sure if the ability to use it ends when my Prime membership ends or not."
"November 2, 2017","User-friendly and has all the songs that I and picked out including my oldies my golden oldies! And I enjoy working with it thank you."
"October 25, 2015","Good app but on the blackberry z10 it gives me some trouble but nothing just restarting the app will not fix."
"March 13, 2017","Nice to have on the phone, but it doesn't work with the Samsung Multiroom app unless you buy songs for your library - at least so far I didn't find a way to use it with my bluetooth speaker at home."
"January 9, 2016","The search function could be more user friendly, and it would be awesome if you could organize your library by genre, so if you want to hear only a specific type of music, you ould do that. I understand that there are playlists for this, but the amount of songs you can add to each list is limited to like 60. Its better suited to ppl who dont have as much music on it."
"September 28, 2016","Totally Great"
"October 14, 2015","Works great j my phone, Kinrle Fire, and pc. Can't seem to get it on my older tablet but I'm still working on it."
"June 17, 2015","I'm still new to using it but I live it. I've been trying to findicate something to play while I sleep. I was using u tube but it would turn off if my screen went dark."
"July 23, 2017","like it"
"April 12, 2013","I listen to music, as I take my daily walk. I chose this product, because the FM radio app was non-functional, and at times Pandora is unreliable. The Amazon MP3 app is amazing. It's always there! I like that I can create customized playlists--never had one before. The fact that music I buy from Amazon is downloadable to my electronic devices is truly slick. I purchasedd an MP3 player for one of my grandchildren, but the whole thing seemed too mysterious and complicated to me. I'm not too savvy with apps anyway, but I am regularly discovering some new capability of the Amazon MP3 app. Thank you Amazon, for making this free app available to your customers."
"July 31, 2017","I'm an international subscriber. I couldn't make use of my prime music nor videos. I couldn't even buy anything. My credit card is accepted for goods purchases but not for music or videos. Apple is doing a better job! Too bad."
"June 8, 2016","really great selection & gteat to have all in 1 place."
"June 16, 2014","On my Samsung Galaxy S4; this app will not play songs from Prime Music. Before the upgrade, I used this app extensively, and liked it. It now either freezes, crashes, or freezes and crashes every time I try to play any of the Prime Music songs. The songs in my library before the upgrade wok fine. So essentially, Prime music has added zero songs for my enjoyment, and the app upgrade has broken the app. Well played!"
"February 4, 2016","Unable to use or get use out of it. All of Amazon Prime was so totally non-user friendly that I gave up for the second time and got my money back (again). They need to consolidate some things quickly. What a waste of a great idea. You need to fire your head of organizations. When you fix it, please call me. Signed: wish I could have spent my $105.00 dollars."
"November 4, 2015","never did figure out how to get any of the benefits of prime to work before my free trial ended. no clue how to play music or watch anything"
"December 29, 2016","I love the app when I am using it, but when I am not actively using the app it is still responsible for 25% of the battery drain. Samsung S7 edge up to date stock. Fix this unnecessary drain since my guess is the only thing it is doing during non-use is collecting data."
"December 26, 2015","Love it. What a wonderful app to have with prime membership. Definitely worth it and makes listening to music and skipping as easy as a button click. Would recommend over other music apps due to music selection and simplicity of usage."
"March 11, 2016","I love this! I listened to Pandora for a long long time. Then I found out that this was a benefit of having an Amazon Prime account. So I went through and added a whole bunch of songs. I found it easiest to look up a song, then go to a playlist it was in, and then add songs like a crazy person from there LOL I now have a very large library and often open up Amazon music and hit Shuffle and go about doing my chores, or cleaning up around the house. Certainly makes it more enjoyable! And it's nice to have ALL songs that I like. And with most of them, I've been able to add to my playlist for free. You can even download for offline play. Not every song is on here but I have only found one that I really wanted that wasn't. And I purchased it for 99 cents. I love this app/ bonus feature of Amazon Prime"
"November 11, 2017","Solid player."
"September 5, 2017","awesome music"
"November 3, 2017","Spotify is easier to use"
"June 6, 2016","No commercials - good user interface. The content is not as broad as Spotify but I found lots of music I like. Also, Jason Aldean is on Amazon Music but not on Apple's music site."
"December 4, 2015","I absolutely love Amazon Prime and Amazon music and Amazon shopping and anything Amazon... Keep it up Amazon!"
"December 2, 2015","A great service and well worth it. You can find most any kind of music with the exception of some older songs. Some great movies to watch though I haven't gotten a chance to watch a lot of them. Orders placed with prime arrived on time and no problems. I would recommend to anyone who likes to watch movies or listen to music and wants to get your orders in a couple of days."
"June 29, 2014","This new update will not play music if no cell or Wi-Fi is available. My music is on my device and all I get is the rotating circle looking for service. However, I can play music through Google player, or the device's music player.  I didn't even know about the lack of storage on my SD card. Every so often, I get a glitch and need to reset my phone. I should not have to re-download all my music. Before, I would pull my SD card, reset phone, and re-mount the SD card continue listening to music. Not happy!"
"August 11, 2016","Would NOT play audio on android. Show that it's playing but NO! audio. Tried everything to no avail. Even reformatted device and still no audio! DISSAPOINTED!"
"May 8, 2017","Amazon music is easy to use and I can find anything I want to listen to on it. I'm so much happier since I started my service. Since starting it I've dropped my Sirius account and Pandora. Strictly Amazon music for this girl from now on!"
"August 15, 2015","I have Rhapsody now, so that is what I have to compare it to. I have to pay a subscription for both prime and rhapsody. The difference is, rhapsody is easier and I don't have to pay additional for a lot of the songs. The easier to use would be to much to write. I love the idea of one place like prime to do videos/music/food(way to expensive!)/Shopping but the price and ease needs to get better on prime."
"August 13, 2015","Amazon Music with Prime Music All kinds of music are passions of mine. I am a Prime Amazon member but have to say; next to the two-day shipping that Prime members receive, this is the second best feature offered. I have the app on my phone, my Kindle, and my computers. They ALL work great and I have not had any problems at all with them. The app has ""stations"" that I absolutely love because they are already put together playlists that actually go well together. I can make my own playlists with east on all devices. You can separate each song by album, singer, or genre. The platform is the same on each device which is great - no further learning on each device. I have over 6,000 songs on my app and have used MANY other similar apps from other companies. They do not come close to this easy to use great app."
"July 23, 2016","The app itself could be easier to navigate, but I'm still going to give it a high rating because if I hear a new song on the radio I have not had a problem also getting to listen to that song on this app for free. Anyway, it's not a perfect interface but they make up for by giving a great selection of music."
"February 10, 2013","I've used this app in the past without any trouble on my current phone (Motorola Atrix 2) and on a PC and Samsung tablet, but now I cannot get the app to work properly on my Atrix 2. Logging in just wouldn't happen until I restarted the phone, and after finally logging in, now it won't load my cloud music. It just cycles with the message ""Loading your cloud music..."". My connection via wifi is good and everything else works just fine. I'm assuming this is caused by a recent update."
"July 5, 2015","Wide variety of music. Its just ridiculous they want $99 up front just to tie you to a contract on something you probably won't use daily."
"November 23, 2012","After buying some items on amazon I was rewarded a dollar to verbal song on amazon music I went to buy a song with that dollar and halfway through it says I don't have internet when I'm using WiFi I checked and my WiFi was fine so I switched to my 3g and tried it again and it still wouldn't download. So, very frustrated I gave up and just went about my day and two hours later I get two emails one saying I used my reward and another charging me 98 cents. I looked through everything with music and it never downloaded and I have no way of getting the songs unless I bought them again. What a rip off ! If there was a way to retrieved my songs I would be happy but as far as I can tell there isn't :("
"August 23, 2017","Good app lots of music"
"January 2, 2016","This app has worked perfectly for me since I installed it. I can download music and also stream from my library with no problems."
"May 17, 2016","As an Amazon Prime user I have been able to build a sizable library of music using Amazon Prime songs and albums. This app has allowed me to go back 5,10,20years or more and cherry pick many of my favorite songs from the past, along near current sounds. It is not why I am a member of Prime but it is icing on top of the cake."
"November 20, 2014","If an app MUST crash, it should do it once and get it over with. NOT keep bringing up the ""Unfortunately, Amazon Music has stopped"" box over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I couldn't report the crash to Google because the crash box wouldn't stay out of the way long enough to file the report. Couldn't get to the Application Manager to force stop the program because the crash box kept coming up. Deleting this piece of malware NOW."
"May 18, 2015","As a Prime member, this app is pretty much an essential on my phone and Kindle Fire. I love creating playlists and have found a lot of great music to listen to for free. I would recommend this over Pandora (my previous favorite) any day! I wish that it would recommend music as I love to discover new artists but so far I've made it work by cross referencing a certain song with what others have added in playlists containing it."
"May 29, 2017","Why should I have to pay for it when I'm already a prime member? No thanks! !!!!"
"March 1, 2016","Could not make this App work on my device, canceled the order."
"November 28, 2014","I downloaded it to my phone, but it won't open. I keep on touching the ""Open"" button on my screen, and nothing happens. Exteremly frustrated, especially after purchasing a song!"
"July 31, 2015","I like to listen offline. Your service requires me to be online to use it while driving, therefore wasting my valuable data. Music downloaded to my library should be available when and where I want it without having to stream it every time. You can do this by requiring the user to update every week or month like other services do. If they don't update frequently the music deletes or locks until they do."
"September 29, 2016","I love having this ap to listen to full albums! It's a pain if it won't load sometimes, but a lot of that is just Internet connection."
"January 5, 2015","OMG!!! The BEST thing I ever got! I LOVE being able to get the old music I grew up on and the new artists I discover. I have recommended this to everyone I know. The cost of Amazon Prime with all that I get for the dollars is the best money I spend every year. This music just makes it better. I NEVER have trouble playing the music and being able to download music and have it in the cloud so I can hear it anywhere makes this the best music source I have used."
"October 7, 2015","Music Collection under prime could be better, nevertheless i am happy with it because i don't need my spotify subscription --edit-- After enjoying the app for about a week it got disabled because i don't have a USA issued credit card... i wonder why my money and international credit card is good to pay for the prime subscription but not good enough to use/buy music with this app..."
"June 14, 2016","Beats Pandora! You can go back and listen to a song again, skip unlimited, no commercials/advertisements, and it doesn't stop playing with ""are you still listening?"""
"July 27, 2016","Good deal. Build your own list."
"June 26, 2015","I've rated this a 1 star because I don't WANT to have to be DRM'd to my music, but I own like five songs here, so I occasionally download it- mainly because I get a $1 .mp3 credit for digital purchases at times so... I get this to pick the song I'll never listen to: Then I uninstall it."
"January 26, 2016","I have yet to figure out what is free and what isn't. Got really scared off when I downloaded a playlist and it said 60+ songs bought? Tried reaching out to Amazon but never received any reply. I am admittedly not much of a tech person, and so far there haven't been any charges. I deleted the playlist and went back to Pandora which is dummy proof."
"December 18, 2016","Great app! I cannot live without my amazon music. You can shop, create play lists and will show up as apart of your regular music app that's on your phone. Keep in mind you can do most of this but I do have prime which may be allowing me to do all of these things."
"January 28, 2016","Terrible interface. Horrible when driving. Terrible blue tooth compatibility. Playlists dont always transfer. Terrible ability to scan for new music. Synching sucks. Slow as hell. A failure and disgrace for amazon."
"March 8, 2017","Love and use it"
"April 3, 2016","Really? How about flip a switch And let this run on my Shield Tablet."
"January 29, 2015","Dear Amazon, USA is an international country with people speaking on more than 6 most common languages. Android (thanks to Google folks) kind of thought of this, so Android system is adjustable for any of more than 50 languages. I do not have any problems with &#34;ONLY ENGLISH&#34; programs working just fine on my &#34;RUSSIAN&#34; phone, but somehow in order to listen to Amazon MUSIC I need to change my phone's language to English... How music is related to language? Will Amazon Music program try to speak with me? Am I suspected not fluent in English if my phone is on different language settings? C'mon, Amazon, make yourself not limited to English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Chinese if you want to promote selling stuff like music - your competitor Google Music does not have such problems. Until this will be fixed, I would stay with Google."
"August 31, 2015","I am unable to download purchased music to my phone/tablet. The only way to access is through the internet. I like to use my purchase music as ringtones and things. However, one can listen to the playlist from one's phone/tablet but not the other way. They call it offline music. Tried to return for a refund but could not find the option. I can purchase the album and download it that way."
"May 5, 2017","Good music selection. No streaming issues."
"October 22, 2015","It's not horrible, but it doesn't have near the music selection that spotify does. It wants to charge you for so much."
"November 2, 2017","I did not think I would have to give more money to hear the music when I want to."
"July 5, 2016","Not overly user friendly. Lacks any serious interactive functions. Your downloaded music for offline listening has to be individually added to Playlist. There seems to be no way to modify the properties of the individual audio files to identify a song as a genre that you think it more closely resembles."
"March 26, 2016","I love music and this is the best I have found. I can't think of any song or artist that I haven't been able to find. Rock, r&b,pop,easy listening rock /opera,metal. It is awesome it,s not like the generic music apps. this ""thing"" has so many options and no commercials. it really does listen to me and follows my lead. cool"
"July 22, 2017","nice"
"March 4, 2014","This is an easy to use site. It provides a cloud for your music and also puts in all cds that you had previously purchased in the cloud which was great for my husband's phone. Thank you Amazon for another great service."
"July 18, 2017","I think it's great! Better than Pandora."
"September 12, 2015","Don't care about the nay sayers. Prime is great, so oo many songs, playlists and genres of music to choose from. I also use Pandora. I pnow prefer Prime over pandora because I can play my music offline. There are a lot of music apps out there. They all have things you will love or hate. Give them a try, especially the ones with free trials. Simply pick the one that works best for you."
"August 26, 2015","Worst app and service ever there is never any good music to download without paying for it. I would be upset but its included in prime."
"July 19, 2017","Does what it says on the tin."
"October 28, 2016","I listen to a wide variety of music. Amazon has a lot. I absolutely love the fact that it's commercial free. I am overall happy with it. Unlike Slacker and iheart where you are limited in use Amazon music gives you the freedom to enjoy what you want to hear."
"February 6, 2015","I'll vote in the mediocre as ""ok"" because that's all it deserves. The main drive for purchasing an Amazon Prime account was for the vast variety of books I can purchase and borrow for my Kindle. Otherwise, the Music app is below par. Clunky download/upload application and the service doesn't have access to thousands of old songs from certain labels. It's good for when playing/streaming music from my PC at home and that's about it."
"May 30, 2016","Love Amazon music. If you have prime there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't have this app and shouldn't be using. This works fantastic with Alexa and has a great selection of music."
"July 18, 2017","LOVE!!!!😍"
"January 21, 2017","Great job"
"October 25, 2016","While this new version of Amazon Music holds mostly all of my music, it's not nearly as user friendly as the previous version."
"August 24, 2016","Service seriously lacking many popular songs and artists that are available on other services. The stations are not varied enough and they don't sufficiently adapt to your thumbs ups/downs. App is weak as well. It's worth using since I already have Prime, but I wouldn't pay extra for this."
"March 8, 2016","I love this addition and listen almost daily. Variety is marvelous!"
"March 30, 2016","The selection is incredible. The quality is top notch. Classical bundle varieties very educational."
"December 31, 2014","my biggest problem with this app is that it continually puts me on a screen wanting me to choose PRIME music. WHY IS THERE NOT AN OPTION TO SAY NO??? I don't have the access to internet that it would need to run it. Some of us don't live in a city where it's everywhere. I live in a rural area and my satellite internet is so much data per month. That's it. So PLEASE give an option to opt out of that without continually being routed back to that screen."
"December 16, 2016","This used to be a great app. Now it sucks to use on a computer. It takes too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different types of music (my play list and stations or other playlists). Also, the logo for Amazon Music makes it seem like it has nothing to do with Amazon. I am listening to Pandora at this point. I would've given it a 1, but I like that I can download my favorites playlist onto my tablet and play in my vehicle."
"November 3, 2016","I'm so glad they brought back the lyrics. I thought they were gone after the most recent update but then there they were. Although I wish like with Google music, when listening to a station, you could see the list of song as they are about to play to customize better."
"March 15, 2017","k"
"September 29, 2016","It is a good addition to prime but the music is still just top pop of what they want you to hear. I would like more off beat choices"
"April 5, 2017","Huge number of songs and type of music"
"August 23, 2014","As a long time Amazon Prime customer I cannot think of a time I have been more upset and hindered by a product in my life. I woke up today to find my cell phone off, once I powered it up I was greeted by rapid fire crash reports showing that prime music had crashed. My phone had to be put into recovery mode twice before the app could be removed. I was able to sent the crash reports to Amazon. I am incredibly upset as I missed several service calls and am setback at least two hours."
"April 27, 2016","Who can't love this app? I use it more than any other streaming apps. Skip songs as many times as you like with no restrictions. Download songs to device, save it to the cloud or just play from Amazon to see if you like it. I can't say enough about this app. It's great!! Sign up for prime and you'll be loving it too!!"
"May 30, 2016","Its great has tons of music and albums also of artists;"
"February 11, 2017","Does what's expected..."
"March 7, 2016","Love it!!! Excellent music selection from every conceivable genre and no commercials!!! My only minor issue is that two family members cannot stream prime music from the cloud at the same time. However, you can still listen to downloaded music/playlists while another streams from the cloud. Amazing benefit of the Prime Membership."
"March 24, 2016","I have tried many music players like this in the past, and this is by far one of the most impressive ones. It has an easy search function, and is smooth with no ads (if you are prime user I'm assuming). And it saves your recently listened to stations in one easy to find list. All in all I am quite impressed with this product."
"March 8, 2016","Great music. Love listening to it while at work and driving. love this app."
"March 31, 2016","i use Roku, and the playlists are hard to sync. if u want to find music u love and play it on your laptop, or phone, its great. if u want to listen to pre made playlists, its not great. if u want to sync to your roku. not so good. and you really cant listen to music downloaded from other sources like u can with google play."
"April 17, 2015","I really like the idea of unlimited music. The problem: it's not unlimited. For the annual fee, I expected to be able to stream any music I wanted. There are limits to the free music. Even older genres must be purchased. The ability to rewind and replay songs is excellent and a definite plus over regular streaming apps like Pandora, Milk, etc., but the complete freedom of free streaming apps is a plus over Amazon music."
"October 8, 2013","I installed this app on my Kindle fire tablet and thought it would be something nice to have when I wanted to listen to some mp3 songs. It started to sync inmediately, and downloading songs. At first I thought they were some sample songs that normally come with new apps and services, but imagine my surprise when I found out that those songs belonged to CD's I had puchased in Amazon several years ago!! I didn't see anything during the app presentation before installing it that would tell me this was to happen, so this was a very pleasant surprise to me. Thank you Amazon !!"
"August 7, 2017","works excellent with my prime account, plenty of music for everyone's taste"
"November 3, 2016","Love it"
"February 3, 2013","I'm Amazon stuff all the way. But for the life of me I cannot get the Cloud to open with this application. Downloaded smoothly, icon on the screen, opens my device stored music list. But when I try to open the cloud, I get ""Exception #151"" and connection error. I followed all the instructions from the site to get the Cloud side of the application to open, but to no avail. So, I've written this particular app off. My Kindle Fire and my computer and laptop all run the Cloud flawlessly, but not the phone.  UPDATE: finally got this to load up and it works fine. now hitches with playback or other issues. Great resource on my Kindle Fire too!"
"November 23, 2016","Loved the app until the update that took the option to use it with ford sync, I hope they bring that feature back"
"June 23, 2016","This app is great, easy to use, and does everything I need it to. I just wish I could search through the music store and buy music without having to change apps."
"June 24, 2014","Really was excited about this addition but the app keeps asking me to renew my prime subscription and to go to the main prime Webpage to see the problem, when entering the Webpage there is no problem. In conclusion I cannot listen to my added music by using the app"
"February 27, 2016","I think it's the best way to buy music these days. You have a selection of what you're looking for, then you get immediate delivery via download, house can burn your copy and then save the purchase unopened, if you want. Plus no driving, store lines or tax, if you're lucky enough to live someplace that doesn't make you pay it."
"May 25, 2017","Does not work with Windows 10."
"June 9, 2016","Always pushing to sell us more stuff."
"September 9, 2015","It's a bit of a crapshoot whether or not the Amazon Music Store loads. It isn't an internet issue, or a maximum data usage issue. My phone (which is new and has no problems with other apps) sometimes sits trying to load it for 20 mins after which I cancel for data usage issues. It has a wide selection but if I can't load the store half the time, how can I access the selection???"
"April 26, 2017","super super happy with Amazon Music."
"July 9, 2014","I'm very unhappy with the shift from Cloud Player t Amazon Music. In most corporate setting employees are not given the choice of browsers they use or what programs they may install, which in this case means I can no longer listen to my purchased music at work. The compatibility with only the latest IE browsers or installing non-IE browsers in an imposibility. I understand Amazon is in the money-making business but some of the recent changes make me think customer service is no longera priority."
"June 26, 2017","Greatest app! All your favorite songs, no adds, unlimited skips and replays. Doesn't ask you if you're still listening. Just another awesome addition to your Amazon Prime account"
"November 24, 2016","I love it..canceled my Sirrius radio subscription. All of the music stations i listened to have an equivalent station on here included woth my Prime membership.. I have been with Sirrius radio since the start up... the app works great too on my Samgung S7."
"May 6, 2017","I really enjoy this site. Songs are so easy to download and make a playlist. It's also very easy to use"
"August 9, 2016","absolutely amazing. Leave it to Amazon to come up with such a great service for Prime members. I admit I have an eclectic love of all types of music. I love all types and when I go to look for it , sure enough it's there. Thank you Amazon for Amazon Music as it has become a favorite"
"March 20, 2017","So nice! music for my soul, I Love it"
"June 9, 2016","Nice add on for prime users but missing a large amount of music i listen to. You can airways but other albums but that kind of defeats the purpose now doesn't it?!?"
"July 20, 2017","Cool. Just started using it. Haven't figured it all out, so far I like it"
"April 22, 2016","A nice addition to my Prime membership. I think overall it is a nice music service but the lack of tracks available has me still using Spotify for most of my music streaming. All in all I'm pleased, its not like I'm paying more for it anyways. For something that I get with my membership its more than I would expect."
"June 7, 2016","ALMOST better than Spotify ;)"
"October 14, 2017","I love Amazon music period. On any device it is awesome."
"June 19, 2017","Just getting started with this looks good so far"
"March 18, 2015","I loves this app til the recent update, now it crashes and when you try to send a report it crashes after generating the report. Lovely. Amazon upped the cost of prime touting new services like prime music but then they can't write an app to let them work, just like prime video this service is sub-par."
"September 13, 2016","😊"
"December 8, 2016","Excellent choice of music New and old. Definitely recommend it to people of all ages and all types of music. Only recently acquired Amazzon Prime but wish I had got it a long time ago. Can also download music on my phone or tablet to listen offline."
"June 1, 2015","The app itself is pretty good. Easy to navigate, and it does what it should. Performance though is a problem. I've used this on my HTC One M7, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, and a Samsung Galaxy S5.all of them have terrible performance. On wifi, it is just barely acceptable. Over 3g or even 4g, it takes an almost obscene amount of time to start streaming. This may be expected when on lower bandwidth connections, but it isn't just that it is buffering. It takes up 90 percent cpu time, impacting anything else I am doing. Seeing the same behavior on 2 M7s, plus the tablet and the S5,indicates it is an app problem. Initially I thought it was a side effect of the initial synching, but the problem continues days later.  On the positive side, being able to download so you can listen offline is great. As I said, the app itself is easy and intuitive for the most part. If the performance can be addressed it will be a great app. As it is, it is relegated to occasional use."
"November 6, 2013","I have HTC Rezound, and I don't know why, but this app does not work. I've updated it, reinstalled it completely and it still will not show my songs. If I flip back and forth (with the buttons) between store and music player/cloud, it will flash the song for half a second (I can see the album art), but there's no way to play it. My music just doesn't show up in the app. My husband also played with it, trying to get it to work, and had no more success than I."
"June 27, 2014","After downloading the mobile app, and signing in to my Prime account, I attempted to stream music to my phone (Android). I was disappointed. It allowed me to download and play one album for free. However, two or three successive attempts to download albums in the Prime library failed, with only small samples being played before I was offered the opportunity to purchase.  Admittedly, I didn't mess with it for long, since the moment called for music (streaming to a Bluetooth speaker) and I didn't want to take the time. So I went immediately to my Sirius Internet account, which worked perfectly. I'm sure that Pandora would also have worked easily, since it always has in the past.  If I wasn't doing something properly, I would say that the site is not intuitive or user-friendly (at least for this Prime member)."
"August 1, 2015","Love the service. Had many up to date music and a lot of classics."
"June 14, 2017","I enjoy getting older music"
"December 16, 2012","This app hasn't blown me away or anything, but it does what it is supposed to. I ended up deleting it off my phone, but that wasn't because it was a bad app. My phone just doesn't have a lot of storage so if I find an app that I do not use often, I quickly delete them."
"May 23, 2017","Love it, it play all my favorites"
"September 28, 2016","i have always loved Amazon Music and used it on my Kindle every day for years. I have bought thousands of songs through it and now it's NOT COMPATIBLE with my Kindle or Amazon TV Stick. What's the point of having Amazon Prime if I can't even use it on my Amazon devices."
"January 11, 2017","I would have given it 5 stars, however, when my Windows 8 computer crashed, during the transfer to the dreaded and despised Windows 10, I lost the ability to play or rip from Amazon Music. No one has been able to correct this; so I now purchase cds."
"December 22, 2016","I bought the Echo Dot for 4 family members and decided to sign up for Amazon Music and I am totally satisfied with both. Just ask ""Alexa, play The Eagles , Hotel California"" and the song plays. I even had Alexa sign me up with one free month."
"March 3, 2017","This is all I listen to anymore! So done with Pandora!"
"September 6, 2017","It isn't free with prime membership as advertised. It's is the same as all other music services that you have to pay $9.99 a month for."
"September 6, 2017","Love buying a single song, accessing from any device, and getting my worship on!"
"September 14, 2017","great!"
"May 2, 2017","I can not give it much more but trying to learn how to use it better. I'm used to other music apps and this is very different. I will give it a month to see for sure"
"June 10, 2017","So far so good."
"November 14, 2016","Great app. Just a small problem with offline music - online music that I download to listen to offline sometimes doesn't actually ""download"". Even though it's check-marked as downloaded, it won't let me play it and it gives me that annoying ""Internet connection required"". It's happened on my Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, and an LG phone. Sometimes the lyrics are not on sync as well, or the art cover gets stuck for one song and the app 'freezes' (it keeps playing music but I cannot tap anything) a bit, then displays it correctly"
"June 5, 2014","I'm ticked. Amazon refuses to release an Amazon instant video app for other Android devices. Amazon is more than happy to take and use Android source, but refuses to support those of us that want to use a device that does more than just consume Amazon content. There are very few choices when it comes to video streaming sites and Amazon needs to get its head straight and start listening."
"December 21, 2016","I use Amazon Music with my Prime membership. I'm very happy with all of the ad free music available. One of the best features is the ability to download music to your device for offline playing. Amazon Music has a good variety of music available."
"July 29, 2017","Great app!"
"December 22, 2014","I have had this app for about 3 weeks and it continues to disappoint. Below are my major complaints.  Won't shut off - if I pause the music, ope my recent apps and click the &#34;x&#34; button to close the app 9/10 times the music player opens itself back up, i have to do this 3 or 4 times to get it to close.  Downloading music - it is great that you can download the Prime music, that is an awesome feature, however, if you only want certain songs from an album and you stop the other songs from downloading, the downloadet pops up everytime you use the app. It says the downloads are paused even though i have canceled the dow loads 12 times. I do not have unlimited data and do not want every song from the albums in question. On the topic of downloading songs, if you search for albums or songs and download them to your phone, often times it will not show them as in your library when you search again, so you can end up downloading several copies of the same song/album. There is not consistency between the music store and your local library.  Glitchy - the app will often glitch when opening or closing and will not respond to commands. I have attempted two reinstalls and still no luck.  Amazon really needs to get their heads together and fix this app, it has a lot of potential, but sucks the big one right now."
"October 23, 2016","I'm listening to ""Hamilton"" the Broadway musical now. What more could I want? My daughters are grown and gone. Can't depend on them to keep me up to date in the music department. Amazon music will fill the bill! Great selection. Thanks Amazon Prime. ;-)"
"July 30, 2015","I'm loving Prime Music! There is so much music, I can listen to any of my favorites! I even like the generated playlists, which doesn't happen on most of the music sites. I've cancelled my Pandora premium, because I just don't use it anymore since I have Prime."
"May 4, 2015","Finally I've foud a space to store and share my choice in music. I like having the player on my computer and my phone. Now trying to figure out about storing in the cloud and playing while streaming--or should I download the song?  I'm still learning but love this app. I have Amazon Prime, and they share lots of the music I like for free.  Definitely my most favorite music playing app."
"September 17, 2017","it is great I went for a 2 mile walk and it played well without interrruptions."
"October 30, 2016","Won't let me download to my phone... keeps giving me an error message.. just wish I could have the old version back"
"June 19, 2015","I buy my music however I cannot burn my music? Yes, I understand, wholeheartedly, that we are in a new tech era where NO ONE would be caught dead burning, little on, listening to a cd, but Im not one of those sheepish lame ""gotta keep up with everyone"" douche bags... I bought my music. Therefore, I should be able to stream it, burn it, copy it (as long as I don't claim it as my own; youtube). Not all cars are equipped with ipod docking devices. Mine has a good ol fashioned cd player, Thank God, oops, I didnt offend anyone by Thanking my Lord did I? I wouldn't be apologetic anyway. I'm not forcing religion on you. Just wanting to burn MY PURCHASED MUSIC!!! Otherwise than that; I would of given it 5 stars."
"February 12, 2016","I really love this music app. I like that I can search and find almost any song. I hate using the Pandora and other apps because you have to wait forever to hear the song you really want to hear.  The app does seem to force close every couple of days. Most of the time it works flawlessly. Another benefit of using prime."
"September 29, 2015","I love the mixed music selections they offer its almost like iTunes Match only better. They already know what albums I'm going to like and suggest them so that I can add them to my play list. Best of all I don't have to pay any extra money it's already included with my Prime Membership. I don't even use iTunes or beats what ever they are calling themselves these days"
"May 3, 2015","I tried to download to my BB via amazon apps and amazon mobile. No luck so, had to use a mirror to download. The app is great, but since it is android and not BB, there is a hiccup once in a while that causes it to crash. Otherwise, the sound quality at the highest level (in a compatible wi-fi environment) is fantastic, and it's better than having to listen to pandora or spotify with their commercials."
"January 7, 2017","Too difficult to deal with. I was able to download some music but I have no idea how to do it again."
"August 29, 2014","Considering the cost of a Prime Membership it would be nice to see more mp3 downloads for ""offline"" listening. It seems to me that having more songs streamed to Prime Members wouldn't cost Amazon all that much more money, especially since most of them are VERY old songs!!! Also, a few more of the newer recordings, or, compilation albums would be nice."
"January 22, 2016","Great app! I can just listen to music on the run, or I can make playlists and mark favorites as I hear them. My favorite thing is being able to download songs for offline listening. That has to be the best feature."
"February 28, 2017","As few features they have for yhis app you might think they would work, unfortunately often they don't. Feels like this app is just a marketing ploy to make people think they are getting more from Amazon prime then they will."
"March 8, 2016","It's one of the best features of Prime. The variety of music that comes as a part of the Prime Music subscription is fantastic. Not everything I want is free, but I haven't found anything yet that cannot be purchased. I listen to it all day at work, when I can, and then crank it up at home on weekends. I love Prime Music."
"February 23, 2017","I can never get my music to download to my phone or laptop for that matter. Its just a HUGE pain in the BUTT!!!!! I can't even figure out how to get my questions answered and who has time to try and figure it out... I wish Zune still existed....."
"June 6, 2017","Half of the time I cannot listen to what I download or it will be playing and stop for no apparent reason or show no internet when internet is not required. Needs some work"
"March 29, 2016","I've been using the Amazon music app for my Samsung Note 4 for about a year now. I love that there are no commercials. Choosing the prime music to listen to its easy and there are so many choices! The prime stations have a good variety of music that the station selects for me to listen. I use it almost every day!"
"August 14, 2015","I was one of the early Prime subscribers, and generally am more than pleased by Amazon, their products and services, and usually have nothing bad to say about Amazon.... However, that having been said, while I do enjoy Amazon Prime Music (APM) I am forced to uninstall it. It is a HUGE, space-consuming app! Let me elaborate: I've had this smart phone for just barely over a year. I don't download many apps and am very selective and careful about apps I do d/l. APM is terrible about wasting space needlessly, in one of the folders within APM, I found numerous folders with names such as [500] and [47] and [200], etc. Within EACH of these numerous folders, I found the EXACT same images of album covers, (many/most of which I never played, viewed, downloaded, etc. - most were from the &#34;Recommended for you&#34; suggestions ubiquitous on Amazon, and the other suggestions, etc.,made by Amazon) Not only does APM d/l and store numerous copies of the same images & data, there's apparently no mechanism to go back and delete the old unnecessary (space-destroying!) data! Even after using other apps to go through and delete all the duplicate images & data, the app STILL was taking OVER 1.96[GIGABYTES!] -let me make this perfectly clear here, that is nearly 2.0 Gigabytes, NOT Megabytes!! WHY ON EARTH DOES AN APP THAT MERELY STREAMS & PLAYS MUSIC &#60;need&#62; TO BE THAT LARGE?!?!?!?!? This is absolutely RIDICULOUS, I *HOPE* someone at Amazon is reading this and looking into this... With APM installed, I was constantly receiving messages from my phone that space was critical and some functions may not work. That was correct, I missed phone calls, could not receive texts, etc., and was unable to update my phone and/or other apps I had installed. This includes my Android system OS, obviously, and virus/malware protection updates, ... and, just to be clear, this overwhelming space-consumption is WITHOUT ANY downloaded music files, and AFTER having used other apps to clean up all the duplicated and unnecessary files!!! Completely unacceptable, thus it gone, uninstalled. When Amazon goes through and rebuilds APM so that it only takes up a REASONABLE amount of space on our phones (which are NOT huge space-storage devices, to begin with!), I will reconsider downloading APM to my phone again!"
"July 18, 2017","The interface is not as intuitive to use in my opinion. I have one album downloaded, and I have to search for the album to play in its entirety."
"June 8, 2015","i can't live without this, it replaced my iPod!!! i thought NOTHING could get between me and my iPod."
"November 8, 2017","Love this. I can listen to music while I study without all the annoying adds."
"December 4, 2013","I had to uninstall this because it caused problems with other software on my computer. Other programs wouldn't work right and when I uninstalled it, they began working correctly again. So although it worked, I can't use it on my computer."
"December 31, 2016","We only use it occasionally, mostly for Beatles stuff. Much smaller selection of music than Spotify."
"December 9, 2016","Won't work on my phone unless I have internet service and won't play music that is stored on my phone"
"October 13, 2017","I signed up on Prime day for the 4 month 0.99 deal and can access songs that are hard to find on Pandora, etc."
"February 6, 2017","Doesn't seem to be much to offer here that has music in which I am interested. I thought this was free, but then it keeps wanting me to upgrade to another level. Not much value from what I understand, especially compared to what I get on Pandora."
"January 7, 2017","Only just started to use Music unlimited ( Also have Echo and Dot) by the way is Brill. Previously used Deezer which was Fab, so far Amazon music is fine my kids on the other hand, not so keen, no Now that's what I call compilations available ."
"August 27, 2011","Having my favorite music with me is vital to my enjoyment of the day. It's easy with iphones, but iphones suck, so I really wanted an easy way to put my music on my Android. this app is the answer. not only is it an exceptionally well designed app, but it has very good variety and some extremely nice features that make it superior to itunes (in my opinion. however, being a classical music listener I would love to see a little variety (even though it is already large) in this genre. another problem I have (which is really more to do with Apple) with it is that it can't play files that are drm protected. granted this is a good way to eliminate competition on apples part, but it is exceptionally annoying. this is more or less a perfect app however, and I highly recommend it."
"August 7, 2017","Downloaded quickly...wide variety of music available. Picked up PRIME Family.package, now everybody's happy!"
"December 28, 2014","Woeks a little quirky when selecting another album to play but it may just me me learning to use it. Good value with the Prime membership."
"June 4, 2016","Pops up every day saying it's ready for installation but just hangs with ""install pending"". Can't get it to uninstall to start over. This on top of it being a huge resource hog with no way to adjust. Total disappointment. Can't wait to get rid of it, even though I pay for Prime."
"August 28, 2017","It's pretty good!"
"June 2, 2017","I need a ""how to"" manual. There is no instruction"
"August 31, 2014","My first download was the Beatles - which turned out to be a front band. The music choices are limited - and the phone app is kind of hard to use on android. But since it comes with free with prime - maybe I'll keep prime as long as you don't keep upping the price. I don't really use the video stream as I have Netflix - which the same thing - the netflix app is easier to use and more recent choices. But I guess that is also nice to have as a backup."
"June 6, 2016","Terrible customer service!!!!!"
"July 13, 2017","This app is 10 times better the the Google music app much easier to navigate"
"September 5, 2015","A great service. Prime Music provides easy and ecomical access to a wide variety of music without commercial interruption. Subscribers are able to choose between listening to individual songs, albums, playlists or stations. A great deal of the music, including the playlists, stations and vintage albums, are available free to Prime Members. More recent recordings can be sampled and purchased for immediate download."
"January 3, 2017","I love how easy it is to create your own playlists and then have them played back on the echo dot!"
"May 17, 2015","I would like to give more stars, but you can't depend on the stream. Tired of having to constantly fix the playback. There are certain playlists that won't play at all. Sure hope Amazon fixes this poor streaming. Plenty other streaming companies to go with that won't disappoint."
"November 16, 2016","good"
"December 4, 2016","I enjoy this service- included in Prime membership, great music selection and I can find basically anything. I don't see the need to use any other music service. Plus unlimited skips and I haven't found a song yet that I couldn't download for free."
"February 9, 2017","Great feature that comes with Amazon prime subscription. Works along the same lines as Pandora, so don't need Pandora anymore. Highly recommend this app"
"July 18, 2017","It has everything. Lots of good listening. Highly guarantee it."
"July 14, 2016","Love it!"
"May 4, 2017","It's awesome love it especially Amazon music unlimited!!"
"May 23, 2014","Amazon sent me an offer for $3.00 in free music so I went to the MP3 store and accidently hit the ""buy"" button rather whatever button I was supposed to hit to get the free offer. Okay, fine, it's only $3.00 but then I couldn't even get the MP3 app to work on my Galaxy 3 Android. I get error #45, which I tried Googling but got no resolve. I'll stick with the I Heart Radio app."
"April 24, 2017","This has been the worst business decision Amazon. I used to love the app and buying music through you. Now you have gotten greedy. I no longer can get any music i download via the mobile app to play on any player but yours. YOur app is ridiculously inferior to other apps. It is slow no matter if streaming or not...In fact, usually all i see is the gray circle of death rather than get to listen to music I OWN. i do NOT stream music. I am cancelling my subscription. IN addition, now when trying to download to my pc...there is NO option to download all. Instead, i have to click EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY ALMOST 5000 SONGS. SO DONE."
"June 17, 2017","Fix this!"
"April 4, 2017","I use this app a lot. Love the pre-made Playlist feature. Works well for long trips"
"August 31, 2017","good"
"August 6, 2015","The music selection is outstanding and the access could not be any easier. Th esuggestions are almost always spot on or very close to what I enjoy and prefer. One more reason that I really enjoy my Prime Membership and plan on being a life long member."
"June 10, 2016","Just Nope...... Nuff said."
"January 22, 2017","I have an audible account in my name and my wife has Amazon Prime in hers. I really wish there was a way to consolidate both accounts. and why the heck cant I listen to music on me echo and my wife is listening in her car? that's just stupid."
"March 3, 2013","I installed this App on both a Samsung smart phone and tablet. Initially, I found the instructions a little confusing. It proved to be better understood if being installed on the device that you intend to use it with. While I still have some questions about the use of this App, I like it because it allows me to play my music I have stored on the Amazon Cloud Drive without taking up the limited storage space on both devices. An imporvement in the instructions would be to state that you need to down load the App with the device on which you intend to use it. So far it is working well without too much difficulity."
"May 14, 2017","Really enjoying it. Great value"
"August 31, 2017","Best way to order only the songs you like at a very reasonable cost! Continue adding older music of all kind and artist that are hard to remember 😘"
"June 10, 2017","Love it!"
"September 29, 2017","Its here If You Want It ."
"December 18, 2015","i use google play music - it has EVERYTHING you could imagine and more."
"April 21, 2016","The only way to listen to your music"
"June 7, 2016","I like it but not as flexible as other music services in terms of being able to cast to devices...also the amount of my own music I can upload is limited."
"May 31, 2017","I downloaded one song after downloading Amazon for Kindle Fire (Android). Then, started reading reviews. Should've done it the other way around! Now, I'm worried about getting screwed over!!!! I sure hope not!"
"April 6, 2015","Fantastic. All the music I could ever want. It crashes a lot though and takes a while to upload from e cloud."
"April 25, 2016","I've had Prime since it was first offered years ago, simply because it seems I order everything from Amazon and, well, like to receive things as quickly as possible. I appreciated the Video's that came later included for members, but to be perfectly honest, the selection seemed limited and unexciting so I rarely use it. I noticed in passing, this new Prime Music and imagined it would also be woefully deficient so never bothered to try it. Until a friend mentioned it enthusiastically to me, so I just this week put the app on my Android. Who knew! I still haven't done a thorough testing after just a few days, but have been extremely impressed by the artists represented. Considering the price of pay music services, this alone covers the cost of Prime. Now, I would keep Prime and did have it long before any of the added offerings were tacked on due to the volume of things I order every year. But if your hesitating, or think this Music service might be a bare bones lame offering, do not hesitate. Loving it! What a nice added bonus to a service I already loved! (No, I don't work for Amazon! Just an honest and frankly unexpected appraisal.)"
"April 7, 2014","Disappointed that it messed all my music up when it imported it over from i-tunes - it mixed a lot of the album covers up with the wrong albums and tracks and doesn't import all types of audio files.  Also find it a little frustrating to navigate through.  The idea is great, but I feel I have wasted my £21.00 yearly subscription and could have spent it better on another product."
"June 28, 2016","Do not care for it"
"April 19, 2016","Seriously I love how I have music free now that I've bought prime. Ty for making such a perfect deal"
"September 30, 2016","Not much music choices and no international genres of music either... Amazon has a long way to go to make it relevant"
"August 10, 2016","I had it originally on my LG G3 phone. One day I went to use it and it wasn't there. I went to reinstall it and it failwd repeatedly."
"June 21, 2015","I'm a loyal Amazon customer, and have been for years. I was really excited when I learned that my Prime subscription included the music service. I was even more excited to use the new Amazon Prime Stations feature. I thought it would be great to no longer use Pandora's ad-laden app. Well, beyond the intrusive nature that Amazon apps have evolved into (seriously, Bezos, what's up with the lack of privacy?) that some others have commented on, the music app needs some help in its basic functionality. It's cumbersome to navigate the search feature (you have to be in just the right sub-area of the app to find what you're looking for). The stations would be great if there were a way at all to search or organize them. As it is now, there are so many stations (100's) and as far as I'm able to tell, they are not really organized in any way, rendering them much less useful. I'm not sure why there isn't a way to search the stations or at least save your favorite ones.  Come on, Amazon! Step up your game with your app design!"
"August 9, 2014","I think adding the free streaming music to the Prime membership is great. It is not as easy to use for me as the old Napster was, but I like it as a substitute for Rhapsody."
"October 6, 2016","Absolutely awesome and free! You can listen to all the physical cds that u have purchased on amazons cloud the albums are automatically saved in the cloud after they are purchased and available to stream or download with this free app!!! What's not to like???"
"September 25, 2015","The app is preset to download updates even if you are on your 4G and ignores the regular android settings of no large downloads except over 801 wireless. Chewed up MULTI-MEGABYTES over 4G before I realized what it, and it's companion apps, had done and how to turn it off. Total BS that they don't set the default update setting to ""Only over wireless"""
"July 23, 2016","Love it"
"February 10, 2016","No longer do I have to carry around CD's anymore & haven't done so in years. Recently, I my music library was just not organized like I wanted it to be. I have several different categories (rock, classical, country, alternative, comedy, Halloween sounds for trick or treaters, Christmas music for sitting around the house, etc.) and have all of it totally organized in its own category. If I'm in the mood for country, I'll just scroll to country, hit ""shuffle all"" & hit play & all country songs on my playlist can be heard in no particular order. Whether it's on my smartphone or on my tablet, it's well worth it !!!"
"March 16, 2017","Got listening"
"July 8, 2015","I went from play music to this. This app needs more functions to be a good music player."
"September 10, 2016","Really hate that I can't just download my songs from Amazon and just play it without having this downloaded. When I open it, it randomly plays songs automatically. Even if I am doing something wrong, I don't want to have to download this to play a song..."
"July 6, 2014","I was seriously impressed with the range and variety of music available. When I read amazon was going to raise the prime cost I thought about dropping the service, the addition of the music has made me reconsider. There are so many benefits to prime now I will probably renew in October. Did you know prime delivered, for free, a college textbook on Sunday via overnight service, that my daughter needed on Monday. I liked prime for the price. Now I love it thanks to the music."
"July 12, 2017","Good but not competitive with Spotify or Apple Music"
"May 2, 2017","The only thing that this really needs is just a stand alone desktop app (like Spotify), would rather not fire up a web browser each and every time I want to use it."
"December 22, 2016","Is a well organized app. I would like to give it a 5 star but I just noticed that I bought a song by accident. Makes me paranoid to listen to songs That have the same name by different artists. I will be more careful in the future. Still is a great app."
"February 2, 2017","Love, love, love my Amazon music. I listen to it at work, at the gym or at home while working around the house. It is worth the Amazon Prime membership for all the awesome perks you get with the membership! Wish I had signed on sooner."
"September 25, 2015","Works well when have good signal otherwise can be annoying when music cuts out."
"October 3, 2017","Works well"
"July 18, 2017","Good but, Doesn't work for Xperia z4 tablet"
"September 19, 2015","I have previously ordered music from Amazon but recently after a purchase I had to download the music app. I was very disgusted having to download app just to hear music I had bought. My phone was then bombarded with ads. This sucks."
"December 5, 2016","Amazon is an App used worldwide so why if I have to be in Panama o another country out of USA or Spain etc I can't use my music benefits if I pay as Prime user like everyone else??? Very disappointed with this app cause I'm unable to use it."
"April 3, 2017","A CLASSIC ROCK station with not ONE song by Led Zeppelin?? A JUAN GABRIEL station with ONE album from the singer and mixed with other genres having NOTHING to do with it. Additionally, songs such as ""Amor Eterno"" listing Juan Gabriel as the singer yet when I play it, it is not Juan Gabriel singing, and there are numerous amounts of songs like that. .An OLDIES station that plays a bunch of basically UNKNOWN songs. When building a play list, we are allowed to add duplicate songs without a warning. Same applies when suggested songs are listed with an option to ""ADD"" to my music when in fact the song is already in my music. I thought Prime Music would be replacing my Pandora, not any time soon. There is not enough room here to list all the issues and suggestions for improvement..."
"June 1, 2015","Too hard to navigate. Unable to figure out how to download as promised. Memory hog remember to shut it down."
"July 23, 2014","This loads perfectly on my phone and I can listen to the music even when I'm not at my desk or at home. I enjoy being able to keep up with my music that I listen to in one place."
"December 31, 2015","I love my Prime Music. The song choices are all that and more. The stations work much like iHeart with the bonus that you can go back to songs already played. There are so many prime free albums you can download to your offline library and sharing between devices is really easy. I use my app several times a week with no issues."
"June 15, 2016","It's ok. Doesn't have all the songs I like, like Spotify does but it's free with prime so I like it. I cancelled Spotify sometimes I wish I didn't."
"June 29, 2017","The only real problem I have with this app is more the fault of my smartphone not having adequate wifi coverage where I work, so anything I want to listen to that's in the ""cloud"" is a problem. Not the apps fault! Stuff I have saved offline in ""My Music"" that's stored on the phone I can listen to all the time. So if you have better than good/great wifi signal, this app will make you hAPPy ! :)"
"November 15, 2014","I order a lot of stuff from Amazon but the 2day shipping is now a benefit to the music. My wife says that I am stuck in the 70's when it comes to music but I do like 50's and 60's rock and roll too. I have put almost 700 songs in my music library and I ain't done yet. Thanks to my iPhone and my tablet and my awesome Bluetooth speaker I can take my favorite music anywhere. Amazon Prime is worth the cost just for the music and the videos."
"June 24, 2016","It's good but not enough music to choose from."
"February 4, 2016","This is a great way to listen to music you already love, and stumble across new music you will grow to love. It's also a fun way to find those hidden gems from your past that you'd forgotten about. I can listen in a bunch of places, and even got a lot of nursery rhymes downloaded to play for my twins wherever we are!"
"March 23, 2016","I listen to this app daily. It is lacking some functionality, but creating playlists is super easy. This app would be better of you could select the music folder to pull from (on an sd card). Also, the last patch broke the continuous repeat one song function. The song only repeats once and then app closes."
"September 20, 2017","Not a fan of their stations"
"November 22, 2016","I am telling everyone I know how amazing the music app is. NO commercials. List to what songs you want, as many times as you want. You do NOT have to listen to music because they want you to. Easy to set up with new releases, or old favorites."
"January 12, 2017","With the updates I can no longer access anything through any of the Amazon apps. It will not bring up the sign in page just sits there on a blank white screen. Iv let it sit there 20 mins and nothing I travel a lot for work and I enjoyed listening to the music I have but now I guess I can't listen to nothing but iHeartRadio"
"July 3, 2015","Should recommend other songs similar to what you're listening to. Also, most radio/playlists suck. Switched to Google Play because they have free playlists (with ads) but a great Gym mix. Step up your game Amazon! I pretty much give them 1/2 my paycheck every two weeks because I love Amazon stuff. This isn't doing it for me though... but I'm sure they'll algorithm it out soon."
"November 8, 2017","Love it!"
"May 10, 2017","Amazon music app. Is awesome Plenty of variety to choose from."
"July 9, 2015","It was easy to browse through all the songs and pick out those I wished to include in playlists, then used Bluetooth to play on my boat. The selection is somewhat limited, but still had plenty of variety. Wish there were some Jimmy Buffet songs to pick, but only knock-offs. Fairly intuitive, one-button play for each playlist - hopefully the available music list will grow!"
"February 4, 2016","Use it all the time, I love the unlimited skips and no commercials. I find living here on Kauai where cell reception is spotty the fact that the app caches some of the data that's being played I experience no skips in the music that is being played even while dipping in and out of service. Keep up the good job Amazon!"
"June 13, 2017","This is the best app, I listen to music everyday, even when I am exercising. Or riding in the car."
"September 5, 2017","Sadly the Amazon Prime Music is a dupe to get the user to subscribe to the more expensive program."
"June 20, 2014","So this is part of my Prime Membership. It is just fine for listening to individual songs or albums. Audio quality is excellent, (something one of the other major streaming services does not really care about.)  Why is it just okay? Because it is not superior when it comes to playlists. The playlists are okay, but short compared to other services. Not something you can just pick and forget for hours of listening. Also the choices of genres need to be expanded."
"August 29, 2017","awesome"
"June 22, 2016","Somewhat unstable when opening. When get updates, my profile and playlists get all screwed up. Other that that pain in the ass issue. Okay app."
"April 8, 2013","As with other 1 star reviewers, if I could give it no stars I would. I've installed and uninstalled at least 1/2 dozen times and resent the amount of my time that's been wasted.  I'm removing this non-functioning MP3 ""Cloud"" player app, which doesn't work anyway, for good from my Samsung Galaxy SII. Keeps telling me to try again when connected to the internet - I AM connected to the internet (happens with my home wi-fi and the built in cell phone internet connection,) and that there is a server failure Error #151 when I try to access the Cloud where my previous purchases supposedly are, although as someone else mentioned it sures lets me get to the music store!  It DOES recognize albums I have copied over to my phone SD card from my laptop (for testing,) but I don't need that to work, there are other players already built into the phone that function quite adequately, thank you very much, if I did want to play music on my phone.  Very very very disappointed in Amazon..who must have jobbed this app out because I have more faith in their attention to quality and customer treatment than this product reflects."
"October 7, 2017","Don't have many selections for what I looking, also is required to pay for prime members."
"June 18, 2016","It's okay but putting together playlist is a pain. I've got one finished and now dread putting together another one. There must be an easier way"
"June 2, 2016","I like the lyrics displayed with each song. Wishing to have a functional button that can turn off the vocals and each song can use like Karaoke song."
"August 14, 2016","It hardly ever works and keeps giving me an error. I've updated it, using it on wifi or data doesn't matter. Always a problem"
"July 26, 2014","I was very reluctant to purchase Amazon Prime to obtain free shipping on all purchases because I only occasionally purchase items on Amazon. However, once I discovered the amount and variety of free music that is available to me on Amazon Prime Music I think that membership is an extremely good deal. And, I think I will be even more satisfied with Amazon Prime membership when I get time to explore the free video library that is available as an Amazon Prime member."
"June 30, 2016","Hard to get to the music difinitely not user friendly... Very limited selection of music in the playlist/genere... I'll stay with Pandora..."
"November 8, 2011","The main reason I like the Amazon MP3 player is that it has the best fast-forward/rewind controls for long tracks such as podcasts or audio books. All the other player either skip too-large sections, or otherwise are not workable for long tracks.  The ability to access tracks in my cloud is also nice."
"January 7, 2017","Love this app. Let's me listen to whatever I want and recommends songs I actually like."
"January 20, 2016","I love you can get albums downloaded to prime account and then I can listen to music when I'm on my Kindle for free! I wish they had more of the albums that I liked on prime, but it's great!"
"December 23, 2013","Easier than i-tunes or notoriously confusing Winamp or MS medial player libraries. However, the quality of cataloging the songs or albums solely depends on quality of mp3 ID tags. Sometimes, the songs from the compilation albums may be split over several albums, and that's only because the ID tags associate the file with particular album. If you are to load your own library of albums anything can happen. However, the Mp3s downloaded from Amazon, whether the albums or compilations, require no action in fixing ID tags."
"May 10, 2016","I love Amazon music. I can access so many albums and soundtracks without feeling obligated to buy anything. I don't use the radio function much but it works fine. This essentially feels like spotify without having to pay for a separate service as I already pay for amazon prime to begin with."
"July 19, 2017","Really only 4 1/2 stars. I like it, but not every song I want is available."
"October 5, 2016","I was enjoying it, until it wipe off my phone and now I can't download. I lost all my songs that I purchased"
"June 15, 2016","Really like it. I just wish they had more music choices in Prime. I've had to buy alot of the songs I like because they weren't listed in Prime."
"October 31, 2016","Well worth the $3.99 a month for music on our Amazon Echo. I've asked Echo to play some songs I thought it wouldn't have and Amazon Music Unlimited has found every one of them. If you've got an Echo I'd say try it for this price it's a good deal!"
"July 17, 2014","Well with the latest update this app is no longer compatible with my phone. It would be great if the old version were available so I could download and play the music I purchased without having to buy... yet another phone. I understand that the addition of prime music might necessitate an upgrade but locking me out of music I paid for is very disillusioning."
"June 19, 2014","I had already loaded up my SD card on my Galaxy S III with tunes from my large CD collection and also added plenty to my Amazon Cloud storage, so I wasn't too worried about having enough music to listen to. However, the Prime Music Service has dozens of playlist that I spent hours reviewing and adding to my favorites. I recommend everyone who loves music to check it out. The catalog from some of the top labels are not available, but it is still an impressive collection!"
"January 27, 2017","I love the Amazon Music app! I thoroughly enjoy all the music that is right at my fingertips whenever I want. Makes time spent in the car much more tolerable, chills me out in the evening, etc. Now I can't imagine being without it."
"April 15, 2017","Love that it includes some free music with prime. I would rather listen and then buy."
"June 29, 2016","I would rather it have gone to my play music app but I didn't have a choice. It took forever to figure out what happened to my downloads. Then I listened which went fine but once I got out, I couldn't find it again. There is no icon. Still haven't found it. I hate this program!"
"November 4, 2017","Simple, ez to navigate"
"April 20, 2015","Still not quite sure how this works - I am hoping to get some new country songs downloaded! I keep working on it and get back to you"
"April 28, 2015","If you have Amazon Prime then you need this app. Quick access to all the music that Amazon Prime offers."
"July 30, 2016","I chose my prime songs, went to download them like normal, it says they down load, to where? There's no option to chose where to save music to on this app, not that I can find anymore. I would like to have my music on my phone, I don't use clouds or streaming stations."
"May 3, 2015","This is a great music service. I like how you can skip songs as much as you want, as well as having the ability to go back to a previous song. So far I'm very impressed with the assortment of songs."
"December 11, 2012","I LOVE AMAZON MP3 PRODUCT .  I Download mp3's from Amazon. This is a free product to download to help store my music & retreive it later for use on other computers or devices like my Android phone. I can even transfer my music from my cloud player to my device. I can't compare it to other similar products, because this is my first product I use to download & store my music. I am a beginner, but it's easy to use. I have lost music on my computer, but i was able to log on to amazon site, sign in & reteive music from past & future purchases. I plan to continue using this product. THANKS AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"July 5, 2015","Prime Music is advertised as having millions of free songs. I was really excited because I have a SONOS whole house sound system and it would be wonderful to have access to this music library. When I went to play Amazon Prime Music on SONOS it only allows me to play Purchased or Uploaded music. I don't get it, I can play thru Bluetooth Speaker but not my WIFI Speakers???"
"January 20, 2016","Easy to navigate. Great selection. Really loved that you can synch your music to the device. Curated channels are a bonus. I also enjoy creating my own mixes. Great addition to Prime."
"August 18, 2015","Listen to the Prime Stations daily with no problem. Good selection of music from many genre"
"August 1, 2016","I enjoy that I can use this app for all of my PCs. Thank you!"
"May 1, 2017","Needs more songs"
"April 19, 2016","The app turns my boring phone into a music making machine, however, the app drains the battery more than any other app I have installed. Given this only drawback, it is still way better than any other music app, even though I'm paying for this service and most of the other music apps are free."
"October 30, 2017","Good"
"February 23, 2017","Absolutely love listening to Amazon Music. Any type of music you can find on Amazon prime exceptional app for music lovers I would definitely recommend"
"April 24, 2013","As the subject line says, I had CD's copied on 2 external drives totaling 18G as well as music on my C drive and it turned all the CD music on my external drives and the C drive into MP3 files. Now I have to recopy all my music, approx 22G to make CD's to play in my car. I or computer. It had no business changing the music I had put on these drives. I don't like the thought one bit of copying all my music back. They should put someway to convert MP3 back into CD's again. Now if you buy MP3 music that should stay the way it was purchased. Leave original music on the computer alone!!"
"August 23, 2017","One star because I am a prime member and Amazon music is included in my membership,but I can't listen to many of the songs unless I pay extra ."
"October 5, 2016","the music I love on my cell phone, it's really great. now when I remember an old song that I haven't thought of for years, or hear a new song that i must have now I can add it to my library before i forget it, and chances are good it's prime eligible"
"May 25, 2016","I like it. It's a great app. Especially when I'm at driving at work."
"May 6, 2017","I contacted Amazon about how nice it is to be able to see the year an album was released and within weeks the android app did this. Excellent customer service and proof they listen!"
"November 21, 2014","I'm finding it difficult to navigate so far. I'm having difficulty using my music from the cloud amazon library on my android."
"July 27, 2014","I am used to listen music in itunes radio or from my itunes library. But in Android I had very limited possibilities to listen music, I ignore if I had bad luck with apps for Andrid or they lack of good music apps for Android, but this, the Amazon app is a very good app for downloading your own purchased and free music! I now can listen good music in my Android cellphone too. (I own Prime membership, so I wonder everyone can have free music without it)."
"October 4, 2017","This app sucks. If you've downloaded music to the app, you won't get it to your phone storage (sd card ) so friggin user unfriendly. I hate it"
"October 11, 2015","Works...need more free should be all free some are not..."
"June 12, 2017","really great program"
"December 31, 2015","Really like this app. I like being able to listen to my selections while I am working on the computer. I have a bluetooth device that pairs my hearing aids with my computer. I can hear the music just fine but no one else does!! Haven't had time yet to explore all of the music available. Looking forward to doing it!!"
"February 2, 2016","I was raised in a period when the singer could be heard singing and be understood what singer was saying. I love the period of 50 through 70. I am able to purchase the songs by original singer,and not buy a album for only few songs.l can get this through amazon and store in clouds or library and listen any time."
"July 26, 2016","Love the wide selection but thumbs down for not being able to stream my library or playlists off-line as promised. Unless I am connected to Wi-Fi. Fix this bug and I would give it 5 stars."
"January 25, 2016","Works great and I haven't stumped it yet when searching for songs"
"June 20, 2017","Love the choices of channel with very little talking"
"June 9, 2016","Well worth getting prime just for the music! I plug my phone up to my AUX cord and listen to all my favorite music. Simple and easy interface!"
"November 4, 2016","Awesome! 1 wish, EQ!!!"
"March 29, 2015","I am not a tech geek and have really not kept up with all the new stuff - but this is amazing. I like I-Heart radio and thought that was good, but to be able to pick my own individual songs (and album if needed) is a wonderful way of creating a playlist just for me!!! LOVE IT"
"October 4, 2017","I LOVE AMAZON MUSIC !!!!!!!"
"June 5, 2013","...but when I am working in Canada I cannot purchase music! Fix this please.  Also, I can't believe this isn't available to Canadians, if you want to make $$$ open this up to Canadians. For Android users there's no options to purchase music like iPhone/iTunes users can. Get with the times man!"
"January 21, 2017","It works decently but pushes to much for unlimited. Difficult to get music set up when your wife has primary email on a family account and you're the second email account. Unlike most amazon products it feels like a money grab."
"February 4, 2016","The streaming music and video services of Amazon are worth the annual fee. It is like the free 2 day shipping is just a nice additional bonus!  The music selection and sound quality are very good. I get a few skips and drops on occasion but that is the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars."
"June 3, 2016","Very difficult to maneuver, unlike Pandora. Also, unlike Pandora, there's no-one to speak to for help and Amazon's electronic help is useless!"
"April 25, 2015","Everytime I played a song it stops 2 or 3 times to ""synch""!!! This is very annoying and distracting and prevents me from enjoying my favorite songs. I did not become a subscriber to be very annoyed. Pandora and Slacker does not ""synch"" why can't you do the same? I am giving you a month to fix this problem and if it stays the same consider my subscription cancelled!"
"October 3, 2017","love this app"
"March 20, 2017","LOVE THIS!!!!"
"March 15, 2016","All the latest music available and for the people in love with the past will love all the choices they have from yesterday's hits. You can store everything simply to your devices and have wherever u go. I don't like that you cannot download and store the music to a SD card other than that great app."
"December 14, 2016","This crashes a few times daily on Chrome. The orange amazon music app on my computer (not browser) updated and has not worked since the last update over a month ago (crashes upon opening). When it works, I do enjoy it thoroughly!"
"August 30, 2017","Limited library, if you only have prime. nice to download for offline listening."
"August 20, 2014","Amazon Music gets 1 star for two reasons. First, because it seems I can no longer download MY music to the SD card on my phone. If I want to download music, it has to be directly to the phone. In the FAQ's in the app, it says that this option is available only on some phones that run Lollipop and KitKat. I just got a new phone that's running Marshmallow, so the option to download music to the SD card is grayed out. I don't choose to clog my phone up with music downloads, or alternatively use up my data streaming it. What is the problem, Amazon? Fix this.  Another issue is that it no longer works with the current version of Ford Sync. There's an option in the app settings that lets Sync control the app through voice activation. If you check that box, Amazon Music crashes. Every single time. I contacted Amazon about this but got no response."
"January 23, 2016","just started using Amazon Music when I run.....having issues with it pausing after every 2nd song or so....might be an issue with my phone, but i don't have this problem with Pandora."
"November 17, 2014","Huge selection, and great audio quality. The user interface is a bit perplexing, and takes some getting used to, and that is why i didn't give it 5 stars. Otherwise great app!  Example of the difficult user interface, Hard to find equalizer settings, forward/rev/play buttons sometimes hide depending on the screen. I think it would be nice if those adjustment controls would be fixed regardless where you navigate."
"January 2, 2016","I love being able to use Prime on all our devices!!"
"May 7, 2015","Charged Battery to 100% before going to BED! Less than 50% charge when I wake up! NO MUSIC or Video playing when I Turn in for the night... JUST Constant useless Notifications from Amazon Apps throughout the day/night!!! Uninstalled All Amazon Apps! Phone back to NORMAL charging every OTHER day! When needed...battery will last up to 4 days! It's a Galaxy MEGA 6.3 inch screen..."
"October 9, 2017","Had it on my old phone, works great."
"September 9, 2017","I love it through my Alexia Dot. it has everything"
"August 28, 2015","Amazon has an extremely limited selection of music compared to Google play music. I tried prime just for streaming music selection trying to save $30/year on music subscription but with the poor selection on Amazon I'm gonna stick with Google."
"December 5, 2015","Have it on kindle HDX 7. Try to play prime music automatically says I have to use this app and takes me a screen that just has a lovely little circle rotating and rotating ( an hour so far) and nothing. No music . Amazon is something wrong with you. You're no longer user friendly and obviously don't read reviews of your apps"
"November 8, 2017","had to cancel after the initial monthly fee, they want to charge for downloads and more. now that I canceled my membership, all my favorites and all the music I put time into finding disappeared."
"July 4, 2014","I have used this app for quite some time. It came installed on my phone as Amazon MP3. I was pleased with the selection and being able to download my purchases to my phone and syncing it with other play lists previously created. Now, with it being the prime music, I can no longer sync it. So now I have to use two different apps to listen to music...DISLIKE!!!  Amazon- please go back to letting us download to our devices so we can use only 1 playlist!"
"July 30, 2017","It is so easy and so many song to choose from that are free"
"March 31, 2015","This app (on a Samsung G4) is very poorly designed. I still can't figure out how to close the app after I start it. There is an option (in the app) to clear the cache and this stops the player. But...why isn't there an option to close. Also (as others have mentioned) the songs are never actually downloaded. They stay in the cloud so you will use your data minutes every time you run it."
"September 19, 2016","I had this app & my phone sent me an update so I did it however after the update the app went away & I purchased a lot of music from you all through this app & now I have no way of retrieving it are you able to help with my issue"
"September 4, 2017","Absolutely love it. All genres are represented. I love oldies, the 50s, and mellow listening. I can listen to all that I wish."
"April 3, 2017","slow Not Responding poorly performing software... free with Prime, but poorly executed. Oh... and content no longer available ... kiss my assish. He's the guy that wrote the code..."
"September 23, 2016","Love Amazon music"
"May 3, 2017","I love this app...it has tons of amazing music choices, easy to use, and my kids love the options for play lists."
"January 19, 2016"," "
"June 6, 2016","Lack of music"
"August 2, 2017","Easy to use"
"June 12, 2016","I love prime music because it has a variety of music. Some songs aren't in their library yet but there's enough there to keep you occupied"
"August 10, 2011","The cool thing about the MP3 app is the Cloud service and the store has some of the music I listen to, is relatively cheaper than iTunes. Cloud service is cool. I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan :)  Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix."
"April 25, 2016","It's kinda cool. It has feature like pre loaded Playlist based on artist or genre. I'm taking off one star because the random with the same style of artist isn't very good. Odd combination of artists and not keeping the same vibe sing after song... As an add-on to prime it's excellent."
"July 20, 2016","easy to use"
"October 19, 2016","I wish there were a way it would help me build playlists from my own music collection but aside from that, I like the service as a Prime member. I wouldn't pay the $10/month for a subscription service since I don't listen to that much music."
"August 6, 2014","I have been using this service for about a month now and it has not been as easy to use as Spotify or Google music. I paid for the upgrade to storage space, but it is not allowing me to upload my music from home. It worked for the bit that was on my laptop but it is just not an intuitive system at this point. As I paid for extra music storage space I am hopeful this is resolved soon, it could be a great way for me to store and listen to my music!"
"June 6, 2017","I bought the Premium Subscription I figured Premium means I can download. my music without the player and put it"
"June 13, 2017","Great service through Amazon Prime, but should be unlimited if you are a Prime member. For that reason, 4 stars."
"June 6, 2016","Music plays well, but no way to rate songs in the mobile app. The music selection is very limited and by no way competes with Google Music."
"July 1, 2016","I really like this app. I was able to download my current favorite OCR and listen to it during a road trip. Downloading isn't available for a lot of the Prime music (although, the OCR I mentioned was Prime). If you can and do, though, it saves your data from streaming!"
"April 27, 2016","Music prime is the best! If you are a prime member you are crazy not to use Music prime. It does not cost anymore."
"April 26, 2016","Great quality! Better than other competitors by far!!!"
"August 11, 2016","Unable to download app on my phone. LG G3. Could not update on previous phone version, after update won't even install"
"June 17, 2016","I love it. There are always new free choices available. It is easy to use & navigate. This is just one more reason that prime is great."
"February 1, 2017","While I like having all my AMZ music in one place, it don't use it too often because it is a resource hog. On PC it just consumes memory endlessly. I usually have to chat contact help to get my purchased music on to my list."
"August 9, 2016","bloated unfriendly interface nearly as bad as iTunes since deleted will never reinstall or buy music from amazon again"
"September 29, 2016","Loving Amazon Music."
"October 28, 2016","My goodness if only my Amazon Music Library worked this well...My only complain about the app is the ""recommendations"" which are either repeats of my purchases or whatever is trendy and not to my taste. Otherwise, love this app."
"February 27, 2016","I love that it has lots of music. There are a few songs that I wanted and couldn't find. However, I was able to upload them from the Itunes store. I like that you have so many free songs and if there are other songs you want you can buy them and download them to any device. Overall, a great product."
"August 24, 2014","Amazon keeps messing up. I get the Amazon music app to purchase music from Amazon, now I get this prime muisic garbage that keeps popping up. Why did Ispend money on a product that just shows ads?  Like the Amazon VOD service, it works great on a Kindle that runs android, but if you have an Android tablet, you are out of luvk. Other VOD services do not require a special tavlet but Amazon does. Amazon is getting worse than Apple."
"May 2, 2017","It doesn't sync correctly for years :("
"March 22, 2016","FINALLY a music app that let's YOU decide what songs you listen to! Genious! I am cancelling my pandora subscription immediately. I wish I had known about this app sooner. Awesome job, AZ! AND...a nice plus that the lyrics are displayed on my Samsung Galaxy S4 Active. ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!"
"May 27, 2016","Kids"
"August 25, 2011","I have been flipping back and forth between Amazon Cloud Drive and Google Music for my 20,000 song collection. While both user interfaces are sluggish, Amazon MP3 player is by far the worse of the two....to the point of being unusable on my EVO 3d. There are extremely long pauses while browsing my collection and frequent force closes. I really would prefer the functionality and layout of Amazon's app, but the horrible lag in browsing the UI is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this app for large music collections. Instead, look at Google Music or Audiogalaxy (the latter only if you can leave your music collection pc on all day). Both have android clients with usable, albiet slow interfaces for large collections."
"April 30, 2017","Unlimited even better."
"March 17, 2015","I purchased this to use on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9(3rd generation) with 64 GB...Since the latest software update(Feb 2015) from Amazon for my Kindle I can play no Prime music and the update erased all my downloaded music(2900+ titles) from my Kindle that I had purchased from Amazon. This app also does not work on my Kindle....Amazon suggests that I do a factory reset but says it probably will not work..."
"April 1, 2015","Loved access to free, streaming, commercial free music, but I wanted to download music to my phone so I could listen without a WiFi connection. Even though the app can be moved to my SD card, the music could only download to my phone. It took up too much space and I had to delete it. If they fix this problem, I'd download again immediately, but as of now, its just takes up too much space which interferes with the function of my phone (to the point where I couldn't update my apps)"
"August 12, 2015","Amazon Music with Prime Music is pretty awesome. I'm sure I haven't began to touch on what type of music can be played but I bet Alexa was tired on the 4th of July when we had company and everyone here was giving her commands, she kept right up with them. Way to go Prime Music and Alexa. I haven't tried it in my car."
"June 15, 2016","These are a nice solid piece that isn't heavy in the ear! Good quality. Smoother- no rough edges. They are small but also noticeable."
"October 3, 2017","Love it."
"March 27, 2016","exceptional great playlists"
"January 15, 2016","I initally got Prime just for the shipping and recently started to use prime music since I seen that they had the Beatles. This is definitly worth it since you will be paying about 10/month for similar services for just the streaming. With Prime you get free shipping, music streaming, tv streaming , and more."
"August 7, 2017","Very easy to use and there is a GREAT library of music!"
"June 23, 2016","Great product...smaller than I thought but that was my error...fits small-mouth Mason jars fine. Well packaged and arrived quickly."
"March 30, 2011","even with a great (home) wifi or strong 3g signal after either around 35 minutes or a few ""skips"" playback will become jerky or cease altogether no matter how much ""buffer"" the app shows. clearing the cache and restarting the app sometimes helps but this shouldn't be necessary.id like to see this addressed"
"June 18, 2016","When it is added to the shipping benefits of Amazon prime and Amazon instant video, it's hard to find any reason at all to complain."
"August 5, 2015","Delivered as promised. Thanks."
"January 6, 2015","When I purchased amazon prime I wondered if it would be worth $99 a year, but since it was our goto source for so many of our everyday purchases I thought we would give it a try. Once I discovered prime instant videos, I dropped netflix, which made the purchase of amazon prime, a wash. Then my son in law introduced me to prime music which will enable me to drop my subsription to Pandora. I love Amazon!!!"
"June 22, 2014","While it does look interesting it is quite confusing. As a prime member I thought all the music was free and without ads. But it was hard to navigate and when I did find a song I liked it was for 99 cents. I was led to believe I would have millions of songs at my disposal for no cost. Make it more user friendly and you guys could really become a force."
"June 18, 2015","Loving my Amazon Music! It's my favorite music app and I use it all the time, both for my own collection and to streaming. Super selection of available music. I really like that I can download so many of my favorites for free. Pretty awesome! I feel like I get my moneys worth with my Prime membership with so many benefits available. One of my smarter investments."
"January 8, 2017","The app will no longer launch on any of my Macs. It works fine on my phone."
"November 28, 2016","Love my amazon music. Great selection of music is available. I have down loaded a lot of free Jazz and country. It will not generate a radio station as well as Pandora but it seems to have more music available than Pandora."
"September 12, 2017","Good Application for music and my playlists."
"June 20, 2014","I was nieve, I guess to think the music could be mine on my computer, not understanding that it's all in the ""cloud"". The whole concept is still settling in on my brain. I do like the sample songs, but you have to keep pressing the new song when one is over, they don't just play, one after the other. Dont chuckle at me, Im new to this stuff.....Amazon continues to be a world of wonder and fun, and the music is just another facet of this diamond"
"January 25, 2017","Would have given 5 stars but I got irritated when alexa couldn't find Arya or songs all of a sudden. When we first got our amazon echo, alexa found everything. Then she got stupid until we paid the $. Now it's all good."
"June 21, 2015","Amazon music with prime? I've turned prime down at least 100 times. Suddenly I have prime after an update? Uh, what the hell. Plus the app crashed constantly or just stops. No reason. It just stops. I've shopped with amazon for years but this prime thing and the music app both suck. And stop trying to trick or entice me to use it."
"March 12, 2013","I'll keep this simple and not write pages of exhausting material. This is a perfectly simple player with big time added perks:  It links to your cloud and almost all cd purchases you've ever made on Amazon.  It's on Roku for easy connection to a home surround system.  You can add your own non-Amazon purchased mp3s and download the files to your drive of choice for further use.  The player can be loaded onto multiple devices that all access your material.  To sum up, this is a highly flexible and functional player. Recommend!"
"October 13, 2016","I love free music. I listen to Pandora, and amazon prime. I also like music videos, so I spend some time on youtube. Amazon prime has mixed music, reading music, dancing music, and music for any other occasion you can think of. Good app."
"January 18, 2016","Prime Music is heaven for a music lover, and streaming through the website on my PC is easy.  But the Android app is a thief. It keeps self-starting day & night, without authorization, using battery, running in the background no matter how often I ""Force Stop"" it or report it. I have a huge music library on microSD & flash drives & on my PC as well as in Amazon's cloud library.  I can stream it through my Sony BluRay player to my with screen mirroring from my tablet - but I have to keep the tablet plugged in to keep playing for multiple hours. I don't bother from my phone, except for streaming music during dental work when I can connect, or on my phone during longish drives, plugged into the car charger.  I wish they would fix it so it only started & ran when invited to do so! And to make it actually stop when stopped!"
"July 7, 2016","The music selection available with Prime music has been poor in the past but recently I have been very pleased with the selection and have actually had difficulties finding music they don't have. Prime music is definitely a great bonus to the Prime subscription."
"November 29, 2014","worked fine with my old phone but will not work with my oneplus one. Probably will not renew my Prime if not corrected."
"September 2, 2016","Couldn't find the file after downloading it to my phone. Only figured out that I had to use the Amazon music player to play the MP3 file. The least intuitive music download ever. Even Walmart does a better job at music downloads than Amazon."
"April 9, 2015","Using the one plus causes a plethora of problems. The number one issue is receiving the #181 error message when trying to play music. Please fix!"
"May 17, 2017","Excellent app that goes cross platform. Many genres available."
"March 20, 2016","It would be better if you could download the songs to your device."
"May 11, 2016","I love Amazon Music and the fact that you can download the music for offline listening but the fact that it drains my battery kills me. I won't even have the app running in the background or anything and I'll come back to my phone in 2 hours and 50% of the battery is drained."
"April 27, 2016","Hard to manipulate and get to where I want to go for the music I downloaded. Unclear where the music is set and to what playlist it goes. It is great if your looking for certain song to play you just look it up and play but trying to retrieve it again takes a little finagling."
"June 26, 2017","Works great! Keep making it better and keep adding more music"
"February 16, 2016","I was a little surprised. Amazon must have updated some stuff because the first time I tried it I hated it and i wrote it off as a Napster/ITUNES wannabe. I'm kind of a music junky, I need it everyday even if only for fifteen minutes. I'm very pleased with Amazon music. Will recommend to friends."
"June 30, 2014","I like the Amazon music service and the new Prime Music seems like a great idea, but when I discover new music and want to download it so I can listen to it without being connected it doesn't always work and is very frustrating. If they make it more simple and allow music to be stored to external memory card I would be happy and be able to purchase slot of music. I miss the old player so I use the standard player that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3·"
"January 23, 2016","I'm not a fan of annual fees that only provide SOME of the service, and peretual nickle & dime fees for eternity. Either pay as you go or make the annual subscription all-inclusive. Other than that, the music that IS included with the subscription fee is pretty extensive, so I'm kinda just nit picking."
"July 2, 2015","Awesome app. Love, love, and more love. Gives you the ability to download the playlists and skip anything you want...with no commercials. You can even randomize the playlists, and more. I just turn on Bob Marley's greatest hits by the pool. If you're a Prime member, there's a MASSIVE selection of music that is...wait for it...completely and totally...FREE!"
"February 10, 2016","Love it.  I use it with my local Wi-Fi on my Android.  Perfect app if you have AmazonPrime, and thus have seemingly limitless access to titles that span more than half a century, without having to pay for them, which makes paying for the occasional title not seem so big a deal."
"March 31, 2015","Good free music is always nice. Streams to my Laptop and smart phone fast, also the cloud is good to have."
"August 17, 2014","Really enjoying this added benefit to my prime membership. I'm just not someone who will generally pay for music, when I can just turn on the radio. But I have to admit it is really nice to be able to put together your own playlist and listen to what you like as an added free benefit. The site has been fairly easy to navigate even for a 50-something guy like me. Give it a try, I think everyone would find something they like on here."
"May 31, 2017","I love Amazon Music. I downloaded a lot of music and Amazon Music makes it sooooo easy to do."
"August 10, 2014","If you are a Prime member and enjoy music, you'll want to check out all the FREE Prime Music offerings, but you'll need this app to be able to have all the selections play accurately and to enable you to download selections to your devices.  I love the Amazon Music with Prime Music application as it makes it easy to see your music at a glance; either by artist, album or playlist. You can also use the Search in the app to find other Prime Music you may have missed and easily add it to your Library.  This app upgrades your paid music too, so you never lose anything you may have already purchased on Amazon. If you have the Amazon Cloud Player, this Amazon Music with Prime Music is essentially an upgrade to that player with the focus on Prime offerings."
"August 20, 2015","Great product. We have had this for months now on our laptop and phones. It has kind of replaced iTunes and Pandora for us. Although my wife still listens to Pandora every once in a while. The promo credit for shipping on a longer time schedule gave us the opportunity to buy lots of songs for free, now we are hooked. Too bad that promo ended."
"November 6, 2015","Love Amazon music. Prime music is awesome. I have the ability to sample most music before I buy and Amazon Prime Playlists are free to listen to, giving me the ability to choose what music I want on the fly. I also love the unlimited skip feature, which means that I never have to listen to a song that I don't care for."
"June 10, 2017","Was so much better until they launched their Unlimited service. I guess my Prime membership is not worth as much as it used to be."
"August 28, 2017","Love the music app I can take my music anywhere I go on all my devices"
"August 30, 2017","Love this app. Very easy to use."
"October 11, 2016","I love the variety of music that Prime Music provided. Whatever songs you're looking for from current to oldies, Prime Music has it. I created a list of songs that I like to listen to everyday and a list just for the gym. I love it!"
"July 20, 2017","It's got a long way to go if it's ever going to compete with other internet music providers."
"November 27, 2016","Playlist are just okay and new music could be guessed...wish more independent were hyped...how about imports and one time issues from artists? Not even an option to buy...music has far more fast or a lexicon...generic app!"
"January 25, 2017","Love it Enjoy it wonderful to have on my pc and tablet . And amazing on the amount of music available that's even hard to find. Best thing I ever did via Amazon FIRE HD Tablet More than satisfactory Thank you Amazon"
"June 1, 2017","To much stuff at the beginning, liked the other app android"
"August 7, 2017","love this additional feature on the Prime, keep adding values to our membership!"
"December 14, 2016","Beautiful choices are made available to us. I listened to the original sound recording of Hamilton with words screened on my phone. To enhance the quality I listened through my Bose Bluetooth. Incredible experience."
"July 18, 2017","Love it easy to download thanks"
"June 17, 2015","I love Amazon Music all I have to do is click on the icon pick one of the many free downloads of music I have picked and sing and soar off into dreamland.All you have to do is select a song or artist and scroll thru the many selections of songs for that artist. Thanks Amazon I love you guys the best thing that has happened since I've been a member. Lady Gee"
"August 1, 2014","I dont like the app at all.. I always used the amazon mp3 player and loved it. When I upgraded to the amazon prime music I have had nothing but trouble out of app. Always gives me payment errors when I try to buy music, freezes up and wont let me change songs. I wish I would have stayed with amazon mp3 player and not changed to this."
"February 4, 2016","I have enjoyed Prime Music's access to any hit I want anytime I want it. I have perused new music, classics--lots of genres. The one and only hitch I see is that it's not always easy to pull up older music. Simple to get new stuff though, and since it's usable on lots of devices it's quite handy."
"April 3, 2016","love that i can listen to entire tracks, and play what i want! sometimes the randomness of pandora isnt quite what im wanting, this fills those needs! Wish i could keep my prime account, but $100 at once is difficult.....now if it was $10/month....like everything else....just sayin"
"December 21, 2016","I thought I loved you Amazon, but it turns out you're just like all the others...  No, really, I liked Amazon because it delivered clean MP3's to my phone that I could transfer to my computer using simple drag and drop from the phone/pc directories. This is EXACTLY why I gave up my IPhone and went to Android, to then find out I had to boycott Google Play too, who, as it turns out, is even more insidious at highjacking your music.  I just want to buy music and be in control of it. I want to be able to manipulate it. I don't want to use a third party cloud storage system. I trust my own ability to keep my music safely backed up,  One last thing - Amazon was awesome too because it didn't conflict with my car's Bluetooth. My car would switch to voice control and back to music seamlessly which Google play never did but the Samsung music player did. Now Amazon, this messes that up again because now I have to get a 3rd party app to unencrypt all of my music on Amazon AGAIN and transfer it to my PC AGAIN, then move it back to my phone to use the stock music player so it works properly in my car.  Yep, I'm divorcing you. So disappointed."
"August 3, 2015","Puts songs directly onto device storage. Needs an option for putting music directly onto the SD card. I've been downloading a few songs at a time and transferring them - a slow process. As for Prime music - it seems to hide it on the device storage with no way of moving to the CD card - My phone was running out of storage until I realized this."
"November 10, 2014","Best site for music ever. I've never had a problem using Amazon Music and with Prime Music tons of my favorite music is free!! Yippee!"
"February 19, 2015","Pain in the but, skips songs so the qualilty is ify and i tried my high speed wifi or my 4G LTE. Makes me reconsider buying from amazon music vs itunes. Only downloaded it because I'm a prime member and I got free music, well, you get what you ""pay for"". only pro was the music i could get but you cant download it to your itunes or any other program its strictly stuck with them."
"June 17, 2016","Music ALL day, what's not too like... Only thing I do not like is that after a couple of hours, about 8hrs, music does repeat."
"February 23, 2016","I am such a huge fan of amazon prime music. I have used other programs in the past, but the selection is hard to beat. I love using the different study mixes as I prepare lectures. My favorite part is the lack of commercials and a price tag seeing as it is included with my prime membership!"
"May 5, 2016","great music selection I play it every day. sick of the Television rubbish ( let music be the food of love ) my only gripe is that when I downloaded the Amazon Prime Music app onto my Android Tablet there is no sound ?. I don't know if everybody as this problem great pity."
"May 15, 2016","It's a nice service, but the selection is limited. And it changes. You could put a song in your playlist today, and tomorrow the rights are pulled and you can no longer access that song or that album. I also find the phone app really annoying and difficult to navigate."
"March 29, 2016","Arguably the best feature of being a prime member.  The playlists, the stations, the ability to download albums for offline playback...ALL FOR FREE (as a Prime Member) makes this a must have.  If you are a prime member and are not utilizing this app, you are missing out!"
"September 16, 2017","I have no idea how to use this and in it doesn't come with any directions and I'm paying for something for nothing"
"November 23, 2015","No competitive pricing on new CDs. I think it's a little difficult to use."
"June 21, 2017","easy to use, love it!"
"January 11, 2016","My Samsung S6 did an update recently, and now most of my music library on here is gone. The downloaded ones, and the cloud ones. Yes, even the music I bought, not just bummed off of prime. My google play music has stayed the same during this update. Loved this app until that, not I just don't bother."
"September 8, 2015","At this point and time I have to give it a bad review. The app worked great until an update would only play songs I had purchased from other apps none of the amazon prime songs would play! So I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and now it comes up with a message that states my device cannot be authenticated! App won't even open now!"
"June 29, 2016","Great app"
"August 3, 2015","Great app. Was able to easily get and download the albums I bought on Amazon. The app was automatically updated once I purchased the album and when I opened the app I could easily download the albums to my phone and tablet."
"July 21, 2015","I previously used Spotify almost exclusivly. When Amazon released this app I tried it out and was very suprised at the amount of music available. The stations are pretty good and you can easily download music to your devices."
"June 7, 2017","While I am a huge fan of Amazon music unlimited, i learned something by accident that I believe people need to know about! If you somehow log off the app or get logged off, all of your downloaded music goes away and you're forced to re-download it all, and like a previous reviewer said, there is no ""download all"" option so you need to download them individually. Amazon needs to warn people about this policy, or change it!"
"December 9, 2015","Aside from the free delivery, the movies that are presented are way outdated. And I already have Rhapsody, so I have no use for Amazon Prime music. I intend to cancel the subscription. Amazon Prime, needs to get better up to date movies to watch. That would make the subscription more worthwhile."
"November 19, 2015","Constantly crashes on my HTC m9. Had to disable app. Can't even uninstall."
"June 18, 2016","I need help bringing up the original classic rock and roll mixed that I had the first time. Music is great! Once I get it."
"June 16, 2016","I have been so HAPPY with Amazon Music, all of the FREE music you are able to download with a prime make the Prime Membership well worth it! The app Itself works great, loads fast and has little to no buffering. Another A+ by Amazon, At the gym is my most favorite time to use the app, with my prime membership most all of my favorite workout songs were FREE to download!! I love the Amazon Music App!"
"January 10, 2016","Pandora must buffer more or something, because they don't skip like amazon does.. It seems like amazon has to reload the music every time a new song comes on. Not seamless."
"October 7, 2015","All in all I have nothing to complain about, those 2 apps for video cameras are not working right (city cam and ispy) and I might be taking them off. The city cam freezes my phone and ispy is not coming in as it should, I have ispy on my windows 8 phone and on that platform it works right,but on the android it is scrambled."
"June 18, 2014","Downloaded this on a Nexus 5, every time it starts it just complains that it is not authenticated and errors out. This is before any prompt asking for authentication or anything. Downloaded from both the Amazon appstore and Google Play. Same result.  When Amazon innovates (Kindle, One-Click, Prime shipping) they hit grand slams. When they copy (Kindle Fire, Appstore, Prime TV, Fire TV, Prime Music, phone??) they come up way short."
"June 10, 2016","Could not get it to work on my Samsung Note 5. Had it, added another amazon app, and this stopped working. I removed and reinstalled with no success. Moving to PLAY Music. Stupid to give a cryptic error and have no support."
"October 7, 2015","I love it! It is so much cooler than Pandora. Especially since I have Prime. No comercials!"
"March 19, 2016","Prime+music=what's not to like."
"April 15, 2015","The music talks! I guess this is a good deal, when compared to, for example, Spotify. You get on-demand, ad-free music, plus other amazon-prime benefits. Part of a bundle deal, if you ask me! Amazon Music is like the added bonus for your shopping experience on Amazon; it seems as if it were already free (but not really). Amazon Music is the cherry on top any ol' cake."
"July 14, 2016","I have really enjoyed using amazon music with prime membership. Good selections and variety. I love ALL that prime membership has to offer. The 2 day shipping, amazon video, and music. It's a no brainer for me. Amazon is my GO TO spot for all my needs"
"May 25, 2016","I love it !!! Always playing exactly what I am looking for. I haven't tried to explore it's capabilites much because it does an awesome job on playing a good mix. I do wonder if I can play a specific song that I have on my mind at the moment. Might try to do this."
"May 5, 2017","I love Amazon Prime and everything that comes along with it. Amazon Music has such a great selection of music."
"July 18, 2017","Works great with Alexa and Echo Dot"
"July 23, 2015","Wow! What a great way to discover new music, create your own playlist or listen to one of theirs. Those songs that are Prime Eligible (free) you can also download to your device. Don't know if I will go back to iTunes again."
"June 19, 2016","Help system is terrible. Trying to figure out how to use the system when my husband is the primary member is ridiculous."
"June 25, 2016","The fact that you can download songs and playlists for free was unexpected. Definitely a great perk for prime members."
"January 20, 2016","This is cool. Like having my own Pandora"
"March 22, 2014","I have been using Amazon exclusively for all my music purchases for years and loved it. Unfortunately, a recent update to all Amazon apps requires them to be linked to one account. Now I have to choose whether to have access to my music and apps or to have access to my Kindle books which are on a separate account. Very disappointing, especially when you consider that Amazon does not all me to merge my two accounts into one. Guess I need to find a new music service."
"January 19, 2016","For a little more than the monthly cost of Pandora One you get to pick your songs & artists with unlimited skips, Amazon Video...and 2-day shipping on Prime purchases!"
"August 16, 2016","Great product."
"September 2, 2016","Lots of new and different types of music to try and experiment with. It's nice that it is included with the prime membership other wise I may not have even bothered using it.  You can download a few items to make them available offline or when your connection is spotty, but after a while they are removed and you have to redownload them.  I mainly use it to listen to classical music, and I have been able to find three new bands/musicians which I really like and would not have known about otherwise."
"March 1, 2016","I like prime music. Being able to stream and download music is really nice in the car. You can can choose what songs you are listening to instead of a radio type app (like Pandora). I haven't noticed my data use increase from other music apps. The download feature is really nice."
"January 8, 2014","This was always a full 5 star for me (I use it on my Asus/Google Nexus 7). With the last update, suddenly you can no longer long tap on a song or artist and ""Add to Now Playing"". Very annoying drop, and no real reason to lose it. Please bring this back, Amazon. Knocked off a point for losing this feature. Not super thrilled with the new interface either, but change is change as far as aesthetics. Bring back Add to Now Playing (like Add to Queue from Google Play Music)."
"December 7, 2015","I love my Amazon Prime. There are so many qualities about Prime, I honestly dont know where to start. I get 2 day delivery for free. I also get free music that comes with a lot of options. You can also at friends to the Prime membership. There are so many benefits you must get to explore all of them."
"May 22, 2016","Useless and poor. Ask to pay another Prime suscription as it says that m'y account is not the same where it s working fine on PC."
"May 17, 2015","I love this app. Love buying all the old songs! Glad I don't really have to buy MP3 just to listen & buy all the old songs!!"
"October 30, 2017","1. Not compatible with Samsung S7! I had to try very hard to install. 2. Loaded music for some reason is divided into many categories for 2-3 songs. This is inconvenient, leave it as it is on the SD-card!"
"May 18, 2016","I love the fact that I get to here album versions of my favorite music whenever and wherever I want to! Very enjoyable!  http://www.amazon.com/Until-Death-Do-You-Part/dp/1530879183/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1459863293&sr=8-4&keywords=until+death+do+you+part"
"June 6, 2016","GREAT SELECTION--- I SPENT HOURS GOING THROUGH THE MUSIC THAT IS AVAILABLE AND HAVEN'T COME TO THE END OF THE SELECTIONS YET"
"October 19, 2016","Will not down load, last version wasn't broke,so why did you ""fix"" it ????"
"August 15, 2016","I am not able to get my Android device to play anything on Amazon Prime Music. My PC does fine though"
"June 21, 2014","the latest update (last week or so) destroyed my use of this app in the car. in the now playing screen, you used to ge able to swipe to go to next song, previous song. this latest update has that functionality, but when you swipe it pops up a context menu. WTF. then you have to click out of that to close it, and then swipe to get to next song.  super lousy bug. that alone is causing me to look for another player."
"December 4, 2015","Very complicated app to use, not user friendly. I use it anyway to get the free music included with prime, but it could be SO much better. -It's difficult to create and add music to playlists. Also it doesn't allow you to have the same song duplicate times on a playlist, so you can listen to it over and over again.(iTunes does, for example.) -Search function is crap. Many times I have typed the name of a song, album, or artist into the search bar, and it can't find what I'm looking for. But if I click and scroll around to find it, it's RIGHT THERE! -&#34;Repeat&#34; button doesn't work. It skips to the next song instead of playing it again. -Downloading music is weird... I always have to go back to the prime music store to double check to see if it downloaded. Sometimes it just doesn't show up under my device's music. There's probably more issues than what I've mentioned. PLEASE redesign your app, Amazon. I buy a lot of things off Amazon.com and I also use audible. With the amount of money I spend here, I should be getting a better app. And so should everyone else over here."
"November 29, 2016","Don't so much care that they are looking for the monthly fee for streaming now. That makes me rather sad. Miss it just being a part of my Prime. This doubles the cost of my Prime on an annual basis. Disappointing."
"December 12, 2015","I love this app it is awesome!! I use it everyday!!"
"November 25, 2016","This new version has totally mixed my music covers, songs, titles and artist! I've done everything the has been recommended and nothing fixes it and you can't roll back to previous version! Unhappy with this App!"
"May 12, 2016","Love the playlists based on artist or genera it has really expanded my artist like. The ability to make my own playlists is great too because I listen to many different types of music as does my boyfriend. It's extremely user friendly on my Samsung and his IPhone."
"June 1, 2017","Love it!"
"December 19, 2015","Songs regularly stop to buffer for no apparent reason. No issues with other streaming sites or with Prime videos/movies. Songs sound scratchy and just plain crappy. Playlist options are great, love the music. Same issue on laptop and mobile. Sigh.. waiting for it to improve to leave IheartRadio."
"September 24, 2015","still learning about it and is a great addition to my music."
"January 31, 2017","I was disappointed at the effort required to get the music play on my phone. Difficult to get back to it as well. Perhaps I dont have the hang of it, but I do have other sites that I use without a problem."
"December 4, 2016","I love being able to look for a song that I've heard on the radio and find it on Amazon Music. Then I can create a folder of all the songs that I'm enjoying on any given day and play them on Alexa! Life is good!"
"September 2, 2016","The phone app won't sync up with my account and keeps telling me to RE-BUY my prime membership."
"July 23, 2015","This is my last year because it costs too much. I love the music streaming but I don't like the movies and books prime memberships. It doesn't suck but it isn't good enough either. Streaming newer movies should never cost more than Red Box rentals who don't charge a membership fee. I'd give it 3.5 stars but no way it gets four stars."
"March 14, 2017","Just because they're isn't a zero star."
"March 14, 2016","Works better than I thought it would....."
"August 5, 2015","Decent application, but does not have the selection of many of the other music streaming apps. Sound quality is good. Apparently, I was mistaken. There is comedy on amazon prime, but there is no way to search for it by genre. I find it irritating that I can only find comedians by searching for them by name. This needs to be improved."
"January 30, 2017","It's great I my taste in music is much different than most great fringe bands that what I like from metal to country if it's not on the radio it's for me. And when I search my favorite band there that are. Best music app around"
"July 5, 2013","I can understand how everyone want to make money off of things.  But the whole splintering of things, just gets to the point of being annoying. Go to Itunes for this, Amazon for that, who knows whoever is going to come with the next new service. Same for video, Warner Brothers apparently pulling videos from Netflix, to form their own service.  If they're going to ""DRM"" things, then there should be the equivalent of a DRM clearing house. If I ""buy"" an album, then that album should be able to check in and let me listen to the thing irrespective of what I'm using online to listen to it. (Idealistic, but then hey, why not wish for the moon?).  Plus, until recently I only had a 3G phone with limited data plans, so what was the point.  And of course speakers on phones suck.  So, Music?  I do Pandora and several other streaming services, but see no need for yet another ""source"" of music.  I have bought music through Amazon's MP3 Service. And other than the poorly documented, confusing interface (downloading), it worked okay. But even then, nothing that I would stream directly via an app.  I really like having it simple, all music coming from pretty much one place.  So so so....  If you use it, more power to you."
"March 29, 2016","The service is fantastic. I really love the music selection and the ability to play what I want, when I want. The mobile app can be a bit flaky from time-to-time, but that could be due more to my phone than the app itself. This has replaced Pandora on all of my devices."
"January 9, 2013","I love my cloud player and have been using it since its humble beginnings. It has come a long way and only gets better. Online editing of metadata helps to fix my music collection and keep things organized. Their music is reasonably priced most of the time in comparison to other MP3 vendors out there too. My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set. I have several android devices, which I think is probably making me more of an exception. Regardless, five as a device limit causes me to pick and choose more often than I like. Ten would be a better number."
"October 20, 2016","How do I love the.... there isn't enough room to count the ways! Your given the opportunity to like or dislike selections and music is played to your desires. Could it get any better..... don't think so! Thank you Amazon!"
"September 15, 2017","I really enjoy listening to various songs that I downloaded."
"July 18, 2017","I love the variety of music that is available!"

"January 28, 2014","I AM A CD MAN AND WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT MP3 MUSIC IN THE CLOUD. BUT, I AM GLAD AMAZON PROMPTED ME TO GIVE IT A TRY. THE SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL WITH BOTH MY BOSE BLUETOOTH AND SONY BLUTOOTH SPEAKER SYSTEMS. I HEAR NO DISTORTION IN MY MUSIC. AND IT MAKES CARRYING A WEEKS WORTH 60 HRS. OF MUSIC EASY & LIGHT! YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A COMPUTER WIZ TO USE THIS SERVICE. AMAZON'S CRACK CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ARE THERE IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS."
"September 16, 2014","I downloaded this app mainly for my kindle hd fire to begin with, I found it to be so easy to navigate and download my music purchases to my computer, now I find that I listen to my music on my kindle when I am out and about and on my computer at home hardly ever using my stereo now. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants music all in the one place both at home and when out and about ................."
"June 21, 2013","I like this app better than Google Play Music.  Easy to use with a simple interface. This app runs perfectly on the Acer Iconia Tab A110-07g08u 7-Inch 8 GB Tablet (Gray)."
"August 1, 2015","Great but wish I could figure out how to play the different genres as a shuffle, since I like to listen to a mix of music. If I could figure out how to play Modern County, Top Hip Hop and Latin Pop would give 5stars."
"July 19, 2014","Update 4/20/2015: Amazon listened. I can now listen to my music and I can say that the app is now pretty awesome.  Unable to listen to any music-neither Prime or purchased. I have been currently (as I type) trying to listen to my music. It's been 15 minutes and no sound. It's still trying to load. I'd rather pay for an app and it work than to get it for free and it not. I don't hate Amazon or its service, only this app."
"January 10, 2017","Great music selection and everything runs without any issues"
"November 3, 2014","Top quality music for free with my membership! It streams really smooth with no buffering slowdowns to note. There is a wide range of music selection as well, and I love the ability to play my music from an app on my phone to keep the number of devices down to a minimum. I'd recommend the interface needs a little bit of work, as it can have a lot going on at one time. But other than that, good music!"
"June 1, 2017","Love It! Easy to use and completes my set of Amazon apps..."
"May 31, 2017","not impressed"
"September 30, 2016","love having my music collection available to stream or download pretty much anywhere"
"November 21, 2015","I love all the FREE songs I've listened to. I need a way to separate my son's songs from mine on the cloud though! Since I let him use it, I now scroll through HUNDREDS of songs that aren't mine. I also wish I could figure out how NOT to accidentally download 2 albums by same group, found out one is ""clean"" other isn't. Had to vet out the ones I doubled. But, it's still well worth it. So, I'm not sure why my son keeps pressing for spotify?"
"June 2, 2015","Needs to be updated to android 4.4 capability, where you can have library on your SD card instead of system memory. This feature has been available on other apps, including Google play music, since December 2013.  That being said I love amazon prime music! I love accessing my library from my kindle, my PC, my phone, or my fire TV stick."
"January 28, 2016","Who doesn't like free!!! I got this digital book and so excited to read and show my kids the beautiful picture that comes with it. I use it as a supplementary material for there world history. It is easy to read and understand. Thank you so much for this opportunity to try your product."
"June 22, 2015","Love the service, hate this app. Constantly hangs on startup on my LG G3. Just loads and loads, have to shut it down, disable data, reopen and listen to device music. Can't get it to stream properly over Mobile Data, just Wi-Fi"
"March 10, 2016","I have only recently discovered Amazon Music, but the early indicators are that it is just what I was looking for. Quite a selection, at least as good as Pandora, and without the commercials. What a nice perk for having Amazon Prime. Which by itself has been money well spent."
"April 15, 2015","This app sucks. What's the point of prime music of the app constantly stops working 1/4 of the way through the first song! Forget about listening to any music you haven't purchased. Forget about listening to a different song after the first one stops working. I have to restart my phone to get a song to play after one freezes just to have a song freeze again!"
"February 26, 2013","I am not a first-mover when it comes to technology, so my love of this might be tempered with a sense of time. Some of you might say well, duh! about the cloud player, but having a free digital copy of most of the CD purchases I make from Amazon is too cool. I can listen to those songs on my phone from the cloud player. Wow. Finally a forward-thinking customer service tool that rewards me for my continued patronage. I now buy almost everything on Amazon, not just music."
"March 16, 2016","I love this app. Although there are songs or artists unavailable for free download, I find the plusses to outright the negative. It has a built-in sleep timer! It will stay on up to 60 minutes while you are falling asleep then will turn itself off. I love this feature!"
"July 24, 2016","Good"
"May 15, 2017","I am able to find almost any song I can think of and I am able to listen to the music on any of my devices. I just start at one song and let it play from there"
"May 24, 2017","If I put none I would have"
"June 16, 2016","Prime music was great when I first got it several months ago. But now it stops playing at least once during every song. I have uninstalled and rebooted it several times with no improvement. I have AT&T as my carrier and am not sure if they have slowed my data speed. I am NOT happy with Amazon Prime Music!"
"October 21, 2014","No longer compatible with my device so I can't give it anymore than one star. Was awesome when it worked though."
"December 24, 2015","Used now for a few weeks. Seems to be a good quality app for music. User friendly"
"January 29, 2016","The only thing this needs is the ability to 'go back' and change a rating for a song. IE: If I ""thumb down"" a track, it'll remove it from play. So, if you accidentally hit the 'thumbs down,' you're potentially removing a song you don't mind or even like from being played indefinitely, with no way of retrieving it.  I sent a message to Amazon in this regard and received a ""we'll send your concern on to the development team,"" but never received a follow-up.  Otherwise, it works great! Good selections, convenient to use the 'cloud' to play on different devices.  My wife wishes we could share playlists/accounts. And it'd be great if you had a ""family"" Prime where each member could access the added features of Amazon Prime Music, Instant Video, etc."
"August 2, 2017","Every song you can think of."
"November 17, 2016","We use this app all the time. Absolutley love it and love the fact that it is airplay compatible. Never have had any issues and the county, pop and top 40 stations are free, no commercials and play great music"
"January 7, 2014","UPDATE: I got a new Samsung S3 and it seems to work really well on this phone, not sure if it was an update to the app or if it just works better on my new phone but the app didn't work before on my Evo 3D  I don't know what they've done to it, but now on my htc evo 3d 4g the widget will not go on the screen, even if the home screen is empty it says there is not enough space. The shortcut in the menu disappears so if you don't make a shortcut on one of your home screens you will be unable to open the app unless you open it from the appstore. It used to work decently, now its completely non functioning. How can I use the app when I can't even use a widget or shortcut to open it? If they at least fix that I'd at least raise it back to like 4 stars."
"September 1, 2015","Best music program out there. Not only can I upload all of my own music and listen to it anywhere prime ha's more music than I could ever listen to. I can also utilize up to 10 devices. Play what you want when you want. No restrictions and to me it's free because I'm gonna pay for prime no matter what so it's a win win! !!"
"August 8, 2015","delivers most of the music I like for free and its getting a lot easier to manage your music for play back and its more fun to ask Echo (alexa) to play an album or certain single song provided its in my library."
"March 12, 2015","It might just be me, but the app will take some getting used to. It's a great product, though!"
"September 7, 2016","I have this on my Galaxy Note 4 and it is great. I especially like it because it gives me the ability to use my GPS tracking app when doing my walk or Bike ride and still listen to music without haveing to carry a second device."
"October 30, 2015","It's the only way I listen to music now; love it."
"January 16, 2017","needs to get some music little faster availability but still great selection of songs and artists"
"June 1, 2015","If you purchase the music, it immediately downloads directly into your specific Playlist of choice. But, if you use the free Prime option, the songs download to ""Never Land"" & you can't retrieve them easily. It's a debacle!"
"January 20, 2016","This is exactly what I was looking for! Music at my fingertips that doesn't need to be clogging up my software. Another great thing I love with Amazon Prime :)"
"August 6, 2015","I LOVE Amazon Prime Music!! It's one of the biggest perks (outside of the 2-day shipping) that my Prime membership affords me. I listen to it all the time at work, in my car, and at home. Love, love, love it."
"May 22, 2016","Well-intentioned but definitely seems to be in a beta version if you will. Could use a car mode, voice commands, and compatibility with S-voice and/or car mode on Samsung Galaxy for optimum usefulness. Thankful for this arm of the Amazon Prime experience!"
"September 6, 2012","The good: It installed easily and doesn't crash my Android 2.3 phone (LG MyTouch Q).  The not-so-good: Mediocre variety and selection of music, at best. No obvious way to use Amazon.com MP3 credits. No idea what happened to the song I selected and thought I downloaded."
"March 5, 2016","LOVE IT"
"September 1, 2017","App works well. Prime Music itself is great. Cloud access on any device. Only complaint is that there's some stuff unavailable on Prime unless you pay extra, but I guess that's just how Amazon does it."
"June 17, 2016","Will not update, keeps kicking out of the update with an 505 error, otherwise, this is my go to app for my music."
"November 21, 2016","This streaming music service is perfect for all of our listening needs -- from the patio to the car and everywhere in between. Once in a great while there will be a hiccup, but for my money it can't be beat."
"September 7, 2016","Well damn. I've had prime for 5 months now. Just used it for the free shipping because I'm revamping my furnishings, but I tried prime music and it had all of the songs I love available to me with wifi which is 16 hrs a day, so yay!"
"November 21, 2016","This used to be a serviceable option for those of us not in iPhones, but now with their new streaming music service Amazon seems to be rapidly abandoning the non-streaming portion part of their music service. They're making it hard to upload your own music and their phone app is draining my battery at an alarming rate even when I don't use it. Time to start migrating to another service before their service crashes all together and you can't even get your music from it anymore."
"January 12, 2016","Love it! Music selections is unlimited"
"November 23, 2015","I tried repeatedly to use this service but when I went to pay for the product it wouldn't allow the payment stating that it couldn't complete the transaction. Finally I got tired of trying to deal through Amazon and went and bought the music through another retailor without the slightest issue."
"November 30, 2016","Love how most songs are available and all the lyrics are there! Can't wait for it to improve to being better than Spotify so I can cancel my premium subscription. Almost there though! Not as many songs yet"
"June 24, 2016","I just joined Prime and so far it is great. I wish that there was a way to randomly sort music that is loaded."
"September 23, 2016","So far it seems fine. The only down side is it doesn't show the album art work for albums in my library that weren't purchased thru amazon. The artwork is on my computer but doesn't carry over to Amazon Music. Frustrating!"
"April 19, 2016","Not enough new music"
"January 5, 2017","Won't work on my country. Only cheap covers."
"December 20, 2013","I downloaded one album and it doesn't work right. Constantly skipping and pausing and jumping around. Very annoying. I deleted it almost immediately from my kindle."
"June 26, 2016","Great music selection and easy to locate any sing in looking for. Amazon is a great service and I receive it free thru Amazon Prime."
"June 26, 2016","A little bit strained getting to what you want to listen to on the Amazon Echo.........but overall I like it."
"June 13, 2016","I replaced Pandora with Amazon Music and the selections are much better and the quality of the audio is superior."
"July 26, 2017","It would be a lot better, if more songs fell under the umbrella of Prime Music. Instead of having to resort to Unlimited music"
"February 4, 2016","Love, Love, Love Amazon.Prime Music! Bluetooth is great in my van! Hooks up quickly and I'm singing along before the van moves! So many choices! I wish I had subscribed to this before I subscribed to SiriusXM! At least now I know so won't need to renew SiriusXM! Thank you Amazon!"
"June 12, 2014","The newly updated music app for Amazon is pretty good. If you are a Prime member/subscriber, you get access to a good amount of free music. All you have to do is update the app and then you get access to ""Add"" songs to your library for free. Then, you can listen to the songs in the order you want and how you want. No ads and no skip limits! Not all new songs are available yet, but the selection is pretty good. Also, the app has settings that let you decide what quality of music file or streaming you want to use (to save on data if you are using your phone's plan). You also get the option to download the songs over WiFi and listen to them later without using up your data plan.  A nice feature is the option to listen to preset playlists based on type of music or mood that you are in. The songs from the playlists are free (if you have Prime).  App works well, and it is great if you have Prime! I would recommend it."
"April 28, 2017","The stations are great and stays on track a lot better than other music apps I've tried."
"November 10, 2016","if I can do it anyone can doit"
"June 7, 2017","Too limited and disorganized on the site"
"September 4, 2017","love this app.//"
"May 2, 2017","Love it!! No ads"
"August 13, 2014","This app has had a few iterations and I appreciate the complexity of adapting a program like this in an agile fashion, But, routinely there are changes that are not thought-through and the constant changes in functionality, removal of some functionality and lack of comprehensive design principles can be very, very frustrating. My latest gripe is the ""download playlist"" button that loads a second after the button right next to it, which is ""shuffle playlist."" Several times now I've gone to push the ""shuffle playlist"" button and then the ""download playlist"" button loads into it's place. Now my phone is slowed down in attempts to download the playlist. When all I wanted to do was listen to the playlist! Rrrrrr. Sometimes I wonder if anyone at Amazon actually uses the product. I do, everyday, and I would love to help (re)design it. Just a bit more attention to design principles is all I ask."
"April 28, 2017","Amazon Music is super and very user-friendly. I am extremely pleased with it. Use it all the time."
"December 2, 2015","The mobile app is pretty good. The site and the desktop app ui needs some work; very beta feeling. Also ran across some music that was encoded at poor quality. The download feature is really nice since I have a limited data plan and free with my prime membership is pretty cool. Looks like the business model is to give you just enough free music to get you to use it, but with holes in collections to get you to purchase more.  They do alow you to upload some of your music, but we still have yet to find the one app/service that will have everything. I currently use 5 now..."
"April 16, 2015","It's great! No commercials. Outstanding sound quality. Numerous choices for songs and playlists."
"August 1, 2017","I found it a bit confusing to use at first."
"June 20, 2014","This takes a little time to figure out how to use on my cellphone. It was a little confusing.  After I finally got the app to work (on my cell) I was listening to music on my PC and then tried to listen to the same stuff on my cell. I got a notice saying you can only listen to one at a time.  For some reason I had a little trouble setting it all up, but I think I now have it.  I like the idea that I can choose from a huge list of music and then transfer it to my phone. HOWEVER, I wish these were MP3's so I could put them on a CD. That would rate this as a 5."
"April 16, 2017","It would be nice to be able to mix all of the music up together instead of just country or just rock or just 80's or just 90's"
"April 22, 2015","It's nice that I can download some of the music and listen when I don't have WIFI."
"May 21, 2016","This is great, my only question is why is every-time I Iisten there is a loud squelch in the speakers about 30 - 60 seconds into the first song? To save your hearing my advice is to start the app, play a song, wait a minute then put in your headphones."
"June 6, 2016","App only works about half the time. It likes to refuse to play downloaded music. Glad I'm not paying extra for it."
"December 4, 2016","1 ) App used to look good, now it's an eyesore. 2 ) When I updated to the new version, it decided to automatically load all of my music files from the HD even though I had this turned off on the old version. An hour after launching the program, it came up, indexing the thousands of wav files I use for music production. Great. Unchecked the load from windows media player again, the library was back to normal. Now today, it decided to load the entire WMP library again because it felt like it. This program isn't worth it anymore."
"April 27, 2016","I was so excited to find this app so i could enjoy my prime music on the go but sadly it sucks. Yes i can download music on the go but it doesnt help when the music wont play or starts buffering and never recovers. I sure hope it will be better in the future"
"September 7, 2015","I enjoyed having music I purchased on amazon on my prime music"
"March 19, 2017","love it"
"July 21, 2017","love it"
"June 3, 2017","I never used the app, I thought I could listen to the music in my car like I do on my computer. But I'm not gonna pay an extra monthly charge for it, I'll just stick with my xm radio."
"September 29, 2017","Constantly autostart with no ability to stop it from happening. Minimal music sorting features. Errors downloading large music collections and have to restart download."
"June 16, 2014","Didn't like having to side load the Amazon App Store in order to get Music. App navigation takes some getting used to. Prime surprised me by having some less mainstream material available. However, some of the more mainstream artists I like are not currently available on Prime. That's the biggest reason for the mediocre rating."
"June 12, 2014","NO COMMERCIALS! Download this, spend a little time searching for your favorite music and if you are a member of Amazon prime there is a good bit you can save to the cloud for FREE and play anytime WITHOUT COMMERCIALS! the more music and wider variety you add, the more suggestions for new music you will get. Even has a setting so the only items you will see are FREE with prime. This app is perfect. Thank you, Amazon."
"February 21, 2015","The app I hate the most. Terrible user interface. Would not let me play music I downloaded to my phone from Amazon Music without signing in with my e-mail address and password. HUH?! This was finally fixed in an update, but still horrible, tiny menus that can not be read at a slight distance (I.E. used in a car) and are completely un-intuitive. The app will ALWAYS try to play Prime Music streaming instead of music on your phone. Hello wasted data $$$. Some artists/songs that I purchased do not show up in different views (title/genre/artist/album). The original app was fine, when Prime Music was added they ruined it."
"June 12, 2014","The prime music service is great. However the app needs improvements. It's clunky, many links into deeper pages are text only when a button would be nicer. You cannot add items to your library without tapping them first, where a long press should be able to give that option."
"April 20, 2015","Impresive benefit as Prime member. Playlist simplicity, HD quality. Truly enjoyed endlessly with no commercials."
"November 23, 2016","I can't get the app to install from Google play or Amazon app"
"September 30, 2017","I am unable to download to my Android phone. No help available."
"June 12, 2017","Easy to use, tremendous library!"
"June 9, 2017","No adds lots of music just doesn't have all the bands i look for or it would be 5 star"
"October 1, 2017","Good Music, Good Selection, Always on point when I need it (mobile offline or online)."
"February 1, 2016","This player is awesome. I tried about 3 other players before deciding on this one. Amazon's player allows me the feeatures I like. It opens to my library, which some other player don't do. I really like that it defaults to my library because I don't use the player for radio."
"May 15, 2017","use it every day!!"
"December 14, 2016","found it difficult to download my music as there were no clear instructions as to how to download them and not knowing that i needed an internet connection to access my purchased music infuriated me"
"December 17, 2015","I love it!!!!! There isn't every artist in here, but it is great that it can come with the full album of the artists that are in here."
"April 15, 2016","Enjoy playing music with this app"
"September 8, 2017","All you need for prime"
"September 11, 2017","I love this app!! I can listen to music anywhere I want and I can also use my credits from purchases to buy songs that I really like! I would highly recommend this app to everyone!!"
"April 28, 2017","It needs more variety. Of music. And mix music too."
"September 21, 2017","Music when I want it, great! 👍"
"February 9, 2016","Lots of good music, some free, some not. I like that I can listen to any music that I had purchased, even when bought on CD. Amazon automatically provides a digital copy of any music you buy. Only three stars as the app is not that easy to navigate. But overall pretty cool."
"June 24, 2017","Didn't work in Portugal"
"April 27, 2015","I love my I pod and this site helps me keep my music New and fresh."
"December 15, 2014","I use thi sapp on my phone and I love it! It comes free with my Prime membership, and that makes it even better!!"
"January 7, 2016","I had a galaxy note 3 and had a playlist, however I got a new phone and not one song from the playlists that i spent hours creating appear on the new phone."
"July 30, 2015","Amazon music is great, love that I can download music to my device and then listen without internet (like on an airplane). The app for my phone does freak out a little though because it doesn't have an internet connection at first, but it settles down and gets on to playing music. I wish it had more available music though."
"May 3, 2017","You most certainly get your money's worth as a Prime customer! Forgetting to cancel my 30 day free trial is one of the best things I have ever done. :)"
"June 15, 2014","I downloaded this Android app onto my BlackBerry Z30 from the Amazon App Store. The app did run but it was very sluggish. I ended up uninstalling it for this reason and also because the song selection available for Prime Streaming was not huge. I do like the idea of this though as I am currently a Spotify customer and would love to see the song selection expanded. I will keep an eye on this service to see if it gets better."
"December 29, 2016","Intuitive, with a wide array of music I love. This gives me the chance to listen to songs I haven't heard in years by artists who had sadly slipped my mind. I love it. What else is there to say?"
"June 12, 2016","Amazon has a great selection to choose from. Much easier to use than most music Apps! I highly recommend!! :)"
"January 25, 2016","love it"
"October 19, 2016","Love everything about amazon and prime except that i can't use my sd card for data, and thus can't use the app much. Stinks to have 50 gigs of space but not be able to download 1 song. Amazon please fix this!"
"July 13, 2017","As described"
"November 28, 2014","I like the idea, and I used to praise the app. Recently however Amazon apps have become hogs of data and battery. I don't know why. But I don't see any good reason for Amazon Music to be running at all after a complete reboot, much less becoming the highest user of data and battery!!!  A recent update seems to have calmed it down a bit, so I'm giving it another chance."
"July 18, 2017","I love the selection and the choices"
"May 12, 2015","I've really enjoyed exploring new music and being able to download it to my device, I don't think it has the volume button skip capability even the screen is off that I enjoy as part of Google Play, it also will just turn off occasionally forcing me to reopen the app which is annoying and is dangerous/should not be done when driving. (Note 4)"
"June 13, 2017","Really like so far, way better than Pandora... I would ask that they give the stations a way to play clean versions of the song .."
"December 15, 2014","Simple, it doesn't work. I paid for music and cannot play it. Only works upon reboot but the problem eventually returns. Tried all different parameters; WiFi on/off, Bluetooth on/off, problem persists. Used to work just five until update so I know this is Amazon's fault."
"July 18, 2017","Easy to use, let the good times roll..."
"September 16, 2015","I only gave it 3 stars because I was hoping my grandson would be able to replace his spotify account with it and save me $10 a month. He tried it and said it is like the prime movie choices. Limited to what is free and the rest you have to pay for. I have to agree there so it really don't quite hit the mark."
"July 19, 2014","None better that I have discovered. Hassle free, straight up MP3 downloads, now with prime, much of it free as well. Any other site you are going to pay for every tune you select. Although things are beginning to change as I recently discovered when my music library was destroyed by nasty gov.agency...one wonders who would that be with some initials like ASN? Could that be asinine?"
"July 23, 2017","Excellent selection."
"February 5, 2017","I have not even dented this service, but so far, it is pretty darn cool. After adding Prime, it got even better. It is so good, I purchased a tablet, just to store and listen when not at home."
"August 7, 2017","Good but not as good as pandora or YouTube Music."
"October 21, 2016","Works great."
"October 23, 2015","I love Amazon Prime music it is great they have really good selection wide variety of music for in ages Carlos Creek streaming Kuwait nice app for playlist bunch of great stuff with Prime membership you get two day free shipping and free movies and service is unbelievable good Thank You Amazon prime"
"November 1, 2016","I love listening to music and Amazon Music has a variety I like."
"April 18, 2011","I use this app both on my EVO phone and my Motorola Xoom tablet and it always works great. I love not having to transfer my songs from the phone to the tablet or viceversa. I connect my phone to my car radio and listen to music as I drive. The only problem I have is that when I get a phone call, the music keeps playing and I have to stop it manually. But still love it."
"April 19, 2014","all my music on my phone! very convenient and easy to use and so on and so forth and here's more words to make up the 14 more required."
"September 2, 2017","Interface is easy to use. There is a pretty good selection of music with the prime membership."
"September 7, 2016","Amazing!!! There is an assortment of music right at your fingertips. I can even go back and play my favorite songs again and again and again! I'm loving that! Good bye Pandora! I've found a new Music App to call Home!😆"
"September 7, 2016","Amazon has a very easy to use and an extensive library. They do a fantastic job at making the artists and generas easy to find and download. With cloud there is no way to run out of space. Customer service is top notch."
"March 28, 2015","Works on most major devices, but if you have an esoteric device (e.g. Oneplus One), it may not work.  There are a bunch of issues with the app, including: - local download process is buggy, some playlists freeze midway through downloads and the notification doesn't disappear without a way to fix it - the license check process sometimes locks you out, especially if you tend to only use the app when you know you'll be offline (like on a plane ride) - the genres are way too specific - the flow of the app was really unintuitive but has now gotten much better - the navigation could use some improvement, there's too much relegated to the left sidebar and few ways to jump around the app from within the main frame - the biggest issue to me, is that I'd love to use this to cache music but use another player to play it - unfortunately, this is blocked"
"May 25, 2015","Best music app since the last update with stations for ios."
"August 6, 2015","I have just begun mining the huge collection Prime can associate with one's musical interests- in my case classical and ancient music. If Amazon can do that surely a more modern assortment must be vast."
"February 23, 2016","good"
"October 17, 2015","This works so good on my weekend workouts at the gym. Great playlists when you don't know what to listen to. huge library so if you know what you like you can accumulate. I didn't know this was a feature of prime till after I got prime. Sooo this will make sure I stay a prime member for a long time."
"August 4, 2016","With the membership...BEST MUSIC ON THE INNERWEB....😎👌😁 I just got out of the hospital after a heart transplant and it was great to listen to music. .what i wanted ..not like that other station i not mention...thanks again❤"
"August 6, 2015","Love the choices and prices! The variety is pretty good! And if you are a Prime Member better!"
"June 10, 2015","Amazon prime is great, as I buy a ton if stuff off of amazon. The prime instant video selections is not too good. I wish there was a way to filter what is paid and what comes free with prime. Prime music is nice, but the playlists are so small. My favorite part is free 2 day shipping, that's super nice and handy. Makes buying easier"
"October 29, 2017","Best content, you hear it somewhere and boom it’s in your music. Great canned playlists for long drives, and in Texas that’s important"
"August 26, 2014","Dear Amazon, maybe this will get your attention... If I can't store music on my SD card on my phone, I can't buy any more music, because I can't store it all, and can't stream on a plane... I'm a dedicated prime member.... PLEASE CHANGE THIS PROGRAM TO STORE MUSIC ON THE SD CARD. I just bought a 64 gb card from amazon to store all my music and it sits there empty. Very, Very Disappointed by this."
"June 12, 2015","I love this service. They don't have every song I want to listen to, but they have most and they certainly have a library that is extensive enough to make great playlists. My son and I use the service all the time to listen to music in the car. There are no commercials, you can skip as much as you want and listen to your playlists in the order you choose. This is perfect for me and I am thrilled that Amazon offers this service as part of my Prime membership."
"June 23, 2015","2 stars. I love music. I had this app on an android phone and it had no SD support. Which made it useless since most android phones have what like 4 gb of internal storage. I've tried running this one a iphone. The app crashes all the time or loses its place and I have to start the app over again. No love there. So this is the big one. I have an Amazon Fire phone. yes, I'm one of the 5 people who bought one of these silly things. But to be honest its a pretty solid phone. So I was really shocked that you have to run this silly app to connect on their phone and not their built in music. On top of that the app stops playing all the time. There I am enjoying a song and all of sudden with no warning. Silence. I can push any button on the phone and the music starts again. Or if I'm lucky the music will start up again with no interaction (like its buffering and this isn't me streaming. I playing the music I ""downloaded""). I can understand the other two platforms not working all the time. I get it, its hard programing for other devices. But this is Amazons own phone! There is no logic in this place."
"May 9, 2017","it plays music well, selection seems to be pretty good, and eventually you can find what you want, but the dark and crowded navigation screens are hard to use in the car/bus/train. it also takes too many clicks to get to where you want to be.  suggestions: - completely mute (or pause) the music when a text or other notification comes in, or when the GPS tries to talk - right now i can't hear most text notification sounds over the music, and can just barely hear the GPS directions (google maps) over the music. - add optional light/dark themes to fit different peoples' tastes and environments - add a FAVORITES section so i can have all my stations, playlists, tracks, etc in one place instead of scattered all over. more than once i've had to really search around for a station i had listened to a while ago, that was no longer listed in ""recents"". - add a CAR MODE with bigger buttons/text so it's easier to use - this would be especially useful for those of us with android car stereo units like this one: HIZPO Quad Core Android 5.1 Car DVD GPS for Toyota RAV4 2006-2012 with 1024x600 Capacitive Touchscreen support Steer Wheel Control Screen Mirror OBD2 TV DVR Stereo Bluetooth SD USB Radio Player"
"July 22, 2017","I absolutely love this app! The music selection is great the offline experience is really good it's just a wonderful app"
"May 21, 2017","Amazon Music has all you'd ever want in music... from the oldies to the newest songs, the newest singers! Check it out!!"
"March 16, 2016","Great selection. Music for everyone...and no commercials!!!!!"
"June 16, 2016","I don't know how i lived before Prime Music! I would spend the money for amazon prime JUST for the music!"
"March 29, 2016","Love the app when it works, as it freezes playing my prime music, and says it has downloaded music when it has not, which are a skosh disturbing."
"August 8, 2015","Love prime music there's not a album I can't find, and creating your own list is really nice!"
"March 2, 2015","Was working great on my Blackberry Z10... until Amazon recently outlawed it for our devices! C'mon, Amazon! Why the hate for Blackberry?!? The app works great with 10.2.1 and with 10.3.1 on the Z10. Please re-enable this app for Blackberry users!!!"
"February 1, 2013","Not sure if you need the cloud, then you get this, as that is the way I did it. But the MP3 uploader works fine. It also searches Amazon for information about each MP3 as they are being uploaded. And I'm sure they covered every file type know. Amazon again keeps you up to date with the latest tech. It's ease of operation is quite simple. If you want things more complicated here, look elsewhere. It's perfect for everyone from 8 to 80. Excellent product."
"August 29, 2017","Not paying for this in top of my prime account."
"March 14, 2014","This is app is fantastic, I kept thinking that the world, was ITunes , but Amazon is super 5 stars this people rule, great service, great music fast downloads."
"May 22, 2015","Awesome, I love the fact that Amazon includes this streaming music service with my Amazon Prime membership! I don't order that many items on Amazon, so was having a hard time justifying the $99/year annual membership fee. Now that they include music and movies/TV and cloud storage with my membership, I think I'll continue subscribing!"
"September 3, 2016","my problem with this app has been going on forever. it crashes multiple times a day and takes all running apps with it...even when it is not being used. Amazon tech spt can't fix it. pretty crappy, that's what I think."
"September 5, 2017","Very happy even though they still want more $$ for some songs. If you have Prime try this. Able to download into app library for listening offline."
"July 19, 2015","I frequently use the competitor to stream my music collection, so I barely use this one. However, it provides all the same features as it's largest competitor, do if you haven't already invested a significant amount of time creating an online music collection elsewhere, then I highly recommend thinking about this service."
"August 6, 2015","I love Prime Music!! Few albums that I would like to see available but this is so convenient."
"October 16, 2017","Fantastic!. I listened all day to my Prime music without interruptions while helping my brother move to his new place."
"October 20, 2016","Enjoy being able to get music for free with being a prime member."
"July 15, 2015","Free Music with my prime membership?!?! What's not to love?"
"February 16, 2017","App works fine. No problems after many months."
"July 19, 2015","I like Prime Music, especially the prime stations. So much ""free"" music (with your $99/year membership). I like the app, on my Windows desktop. I don't like the app on my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S5) for 3 reasons. First, because you can only listen to three sources: Amazon Prime Music, your Amazon Cloud music, or music in your device storage. If you have a lot of MP3s, you either have to forget about them, add them to the cloud for a fee, or try to find them in Prime Music. If I had the ability to access music from a uSD card, I'd give the app at least 4 stars. As it is, it barely qualifies for 3. Second, you can't stream from the app to a wifi stereo receiver like with iTunes Airplay, and Chromecast is not available like it is for so many other apps. Third, the prime stations are absent from the Android (and the Roku) app. What's up with that? One of the best things about the Windows app is absent from the Android app? I've purchased a lot of songs from both iTunes and Amazon MP3, and even a few from Billboard and other sources. The Amazon purchases are available, the iTunes and others are not. I don't want to pay a second fee for cloud storage of all my music on top of the Prime membership just to listen to something I purchased elsewhere. I'm only able to access about half of my music with this app. Make it so I can have all my music on a uSD card and play it through this app, and I'll revisit my score."
"May 4, 2017","Can't get anything out pop"
"May 11, 2017","Very disappointed in this ""Unlimited Music"" plan. I have been an Amazon Prime member for years and really liked ""Prime Music."" When The new plan came out my choices of free music seemed to be greatly reduced, now I have to buy everything I want to add, not to mention the dropping off of songs I have already saved unless I want to purchase them. So I decided to try the ""Unlimited Music"" plan. So far it seems the songs I want are not FREE but have to be purchased. So how can this be Unlimited Free Music? I have read I can pay 10$ a month or 120$ per year and find a new music source. With Amazon Prime I pay 100$ and an added 80$ for ??? Add that together with the fact that many of the items I have been purchasing through Prime are more expensive than from other sellers on the internet I think I am about done with Amazon. Wish it wasn't so."
"August 23, 2017","I use my Alexa device to play my music I love it..thanks"
"November 21, 2015","I was dissapointed that the sound quality of the recording was extremely poor. This was probably associated with creating the mp3 recording. Amazon did refund the money but I would question if there is any quality control an if this problem will happen again. I will probably stick to cds."
"June 22, 2017","Don't like the app"
"September 5, 2016","Takes a while to learn how to navigate through Prime Music which makes it difficult to use. You have to work at it to understand it but all in all I am starting to use it more since I downloaded the app for my phone."
"April 11, 2015","Preinstalled on my new HTC One M9 on VZW. App began crashing before right after I signed in and never stopped. Crashes ever couple of minutes even when it's not open (must be ruining in the background). I've head to disable it just so I could use the phone. I've sent a bunch of crash reports. PLEASE get this fixed! I have a lot of music here!!"
"July 27, 2015","THANK YOU!!!! I love the Amzon Music with Prime music! I enjoy listening to music during the evenings when I get home from work. I connect my phone to Amazon Prime Music and I am in HEAVEN!!! THank YOU!"
"October 29, 2017","excellent, with this app I can listen to my favorite songs anywhere"
"September 20, 2017","Love it"
"February 28, 2015","Love this app!! Love being able to listen to music wherever I am! :D"
"December 11, 2016","I love it! No commercials. If you want to rewind a song you can. If you're on a a road trip or just making dinner, whatever your mood or activity there are endless choices at your fingertips."
"August 27, 2014","Once I learn more about using it I am sure 4 stars will become 5. I am nearly 66 and I have loved music all my life. I love having Bruno Mars and so many other artists available at the touch of my fingers to sing to me. Also great for dancing with the grandbabies."
"June 5, 2016","Need more up to date music to stream also no reggae dance hall music station. No clean today R&B Station."
"February 25, 2016","Wish I could thumbs up/down songs in playlists, not just on stations. Google music has themed stations (like drinks on a Thursday: now choose from 80s pop or country or r&b etc), not just choose by specific artists and they had me listening to a variety of music."
"July 4, 2016","DO NOT PURCHASE!!! Half the tracks are full of static. Sounds like a crappy old record player."
"October 27, 2015","A great add on for prime users, have found most (not all) the music I have been looking for. It was obscure tracks either. The interface could be a bit easier. I found navigating the app a bit annoying at times. All in all though, I enjoy ad free music for free so very happy with Amazon music."
"September 14, 2017","Love it,.I can download songs too so when I'm off line, I always have it...that's great!!!"
"June 26, 2014","very slow and dose not work well on one of my tablets, clunky interface. but has potential. get idea and looking forward to updates"
"November 12, 2016","After exhaustin the music in your collection this simple apps opens a door to an unlimited collection. The audio quality is very good and some songs even have lyrics to help you learn what is son."
"May 16, 2017","great selection, great options, no problems"
"April 3, 2015","It may be my service provider but if I'm not on my WiFi, there are often times when this app force closes."
"October 9, 2016","I want good mix of Samba, Salsa, Cumbia etc. And I want the oldies. Why this partial treatment to Spanish and other languages? Wake up guys, the world is more diversivied, why even USA is more diversified!"
"June 4, 2016","Still discovering more ways for the app to work for me. So far I enjoy using this app and music service"
"April 22, 2014","The Amazon MP3 player is a joy to behold,and even better yo use.Very simply,whatever you get from Amazon (not everything)music wise is able to be played on their MP3 player.Single songs or whole albums.it doesn't matter,Download the app and hear what you've got!As you get more music(MP3's or discs)the more you can listen to,and the quality is very good.So please get the app and start having fun fun fun(as the Beach Boys said)."
"March 29, 2016","Prime offers so many choices in music and can put together great combo's for easy choices in building your playlist. Once Prime understands your music taste, it builds several mixed playlist for you to choose from. It's like having your own personal DJ."
"July 24, 2014","For Version 4.0.4 - App gets the job done, and handily let's you access all content. However, player seems too simplistic to me, and more importantly, there is no option to deactivate the app's checking for cloud songs every ten minutes. This deficiency causes the app to monopolize mobile data.  Recommend adding an option to toggle off the constant cloud checks, and improving player interface."
"May 31, 2016","This is not quite as user friendly as I would like - hard to find and get to songs you have in your library. Wish I could better explain it but it is just frustrating at times. I love having PRIME but wish this app was easier to utilize."
"May 11, 2016","I WAS GIVEN AN AMAZON ECHO AS A GIFT AND SINCE I SIGNED UP FOR AMAZON PRIME MUSIC I ABSOLUTELY LOVE USING MY ECHO. I FIND ALEXA TO BE VERY USEFUL AND NOW THAT I HAVE AMAZON PRIME MUSIC I CAN LISTEN TO ALL KINDS OF MUSIC WHICH I ENJOY SO MUCH."
"June 24, 2016","I love the vast musical library I now have at my finger tips. Perfect for any mood, anywhere. =]"
"March 29, 2016","I enjoy listening while I work. Only one issue but, it might be with my Surface and not necessarily with Amazon Music. It takes a while for the music to stream. I have to repeatedly select before it starts loading. Once it starts, it's good all day!"
"December 10, 2016","Good music app if you have prime subscription"
"June 14, 2016","free shipping free music free movies . better than a sore *****.can't beat it! i am a fan . period!!"
"January 7, 2016","This is a great App to keep all the music you've purchased with Amazon together. I live overseas, so it's even more important that I can use this in an offline mode without a network. I was able to download my playlist to be used when I wasn't on wifi. I just got back from a month traveling, and it was great to have my favorite music on planes, trains and subways no matter what I was up to.  After I downloaded the app it grabbed all the music I've purchased over the years on Amazon. I didn't have to go looking for them, I can play by artist, or album, but usually I shuffle through my entire library. The app also doesn't drain your battery while playing music which is nice. It's been working beautifully.  I am using the app on a Nexus 5 phone"
"December 3, 2014","Not digging it. Whenever Amazon learns to just migrate all these Amazon apps into one like it should be, then ill give it another shot. Im comparing this item to Google Play Music and so far... I have found nothing to beat Google by a long shot. Good luck keeping up with a website that runs approx. 75% of the internet. But one thing amazon does have right..AMAZON PRIME!"
"July 25, 2015","I'm new to the tablet craze. I just got one and have been downloading music from Amazon Prime. I just love it. It's perfect for m as I'm more an oldie person and much of what I listen to is on Prime."
"May 29, 2017","Why must you have the Amazon Music app to listen to the music? Why won't it download directly to my mobile device?"
"April 27, 2016","This night guard is identical to the ones you will find in the toothpaste isle. It comes packaged with 3 mouth guards, in a plastic bag and factory sealed. Works just like the more expensive ones. For my honest review, I received a coupon code."
"March 27, 2014","Really enjoy listening to the music available on the Amazon MP3 player, especially all the free music downloads. I recommend to everyone."
"September 20, 2016","I have issue downloading it every time. I can't enjoy the app when I can't download it. Spent an hour on the phone with both google play store as well as amazon representatives and got no where. Disappointing"
"May 23, 2017","I really enjoy it ..."
"June 18, 2015","Love it it's amazing!!!! Wish I didn't need 4G tho.... Still great :))"
"August 29, 2017","They usually have anything and everything I'm looking for...  A great shopping experience!"
"March 1, 2016","I love all of the free music. My wife has accidentally used large amount of data playing music from Amazon when she thought it was downloaded to her phone, when it was really only added to her cloud. I would like for the app to make this a little more clear."
"September 26, 2014","I love this app! The User Interface is very easy to get accustomed to and the best part is most albums and singles are cheaper than other music apps. I would however suggest that the equalizer be made accessible right from player itself instead of one searching deep within the settings. That aside, it's one of the best music apps and I recommend it for every good music lover out there."
"August 1, 2016","This is amazing. I love being able to download my music so i can listen to it at our lake cottage where there's no wifi. I also enjoy the variety of stations from Christian to Pop to Jazz. Worth every penny for Prime."
"December 18, 2016","Tremendous, ability to set up playlists and listen on any device.. Great service"
"July 24, 2013","Having the ability to stream music on your phone directly from the cloud is convenient. It eliminates the need to manually transfer mp3 files from your computer to your phone. I have an aux input jack that I use to connect my phone to my car stereo, and the audio quality is better than that of Pandora. I have a JBL audio system I installed aftermarket, and so I can hear the difference between a high quality stream and one that has been compressed to save bandwidth. While not CD quality, the audio quality is still excellent.  Caution: the app does use mobile data, so if you have a limited data plan, that is something you might want to watch out for. The app does remind you every time you use it unless you disable the notification. If you're like me, you probably have because you don't want to have to click ok every time you open the app."
"August 1, 2017","I hadn't listened to online music until I got an email reminding me about my Prime account benefits. Wow I've been missing out! I love it! 5 stars!!"
"February 4, 2016","Didn't even realize this came free with our prime membership, what a great resource. Love that there's no ads, unlimited skipping, and can rate things so it picks out better songs. My only hope? That T-Mobile will add it to their unlimited music streaming services"
"January 21, 2016","Great for listening to your Amazon music list."
"June 18, 2014","Awesome new feature for Prime customers. Plenty of great songs to engage the ears. This truly is a wonderful new and unexpected treat."
"December 11, 2012","I really like this app. It has a lot of great features. I really enjoy the option of playing the music directly on the app, as well as downloading the music to your device. I actually use another app for playing the majority of my music on my phone, so the ability to download the music is great! And it downloads in a generic file type so that it is compatible with other programs.  Amazon also offers the same app for download to your computer. That app is excellent! It offers the option to download and automatically add to iTunes."
"September 8, 2017","very good and useful for my android. saves me money from iheart and sirius"
"August 29, 2017","Loved it! Was able to find any music i wanted to hear. Highly recommend."
"March 29, 2016","what a fantastic music app, and I was already paying for it with my yearly subscription. Detailed Playlist already made, every artist you can think of, all stored on the cloud. I'm very impressed! And with X-Ray lyrics...all the lyrics to every song!"
"June 11, 2016","I really enjoy being able to listen to a station or a whole album if I choose. Selection is great."
"April 21, 2014","I rated it why do I need to write a review? If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is."
"February 9, 2017","Amazon music is what I rely on for 99% of my music. It's almost becoming a necessity instead of chioce, which is fine with me. Amazon is open 24/7 and these days music stores are gone."
"February 10, 2016","I really like Amazon music -- BUT -- the ability to repeat one song has been removed? I can only repeat all? Really?? Come on guys!  Workaround to repeat one song: Create a playlist called ""1 Song"" and repeat all.  Otherwise, 5 stars."
"September 25, 2015","It is not fair that I rate this product. I only use the feature to listen to my music from my PC library to my portable devices. I have never purchased music or whatever other perk there are to Amazon Music. I know I am not getting the full benefit of this product, but I'm good. It works for me.."
"February 16, 2016","I'm soon in love with Amazon Music -sung in my Beyonce voice! This music app is the best thing that could ever happen to my phone, song after song , hit after hit. I feel like I have a mini Soul Train with me due to the variety of music from funk to slow jams!"
"September 28, 2016","I like but I don't know how to put it on my actual phone playlist"
"February 16, 2016","This is the BEST thing that has happened to me in a while. I wish I knew long before how easy it was to download a zillion songs of my choice and can share it to other laptops and cell phones in our home. GREAT, GREAT, Product. You will not be disappointed."
"June 26, 2015","Forget trying to find hard to find songs anywhere else!! Amazon has them all! I have never wanted a song that I couldn't find at Amazon and I am a audiophile that has close to 2,000 songs from the 50's to the 90's. They are on the cloud and SAFE and take up no room!!! You can't beat Amazon. Thanks, Selecto- Ruidoso, NM"
"December 2, 2015","I notice quite a bit of clipping, it's not as clean sounding as Pandora running on the same device or machine. They do have a better selection of new releases and you can buy music right inside the app. Has some strong points but it doesn't blow my hair back with music quality."
"July 13, 2013","All positives, no negatives. I like the way you can order it by songs, and I also like how it has a link to the MP3 Store. I wish you could download your cloud playlists independent of the songs, but I suppose that's a moot point, unless... If they could make it so that anytime you are playing something from the Cloud, if it would automatically play the next song in the queue from your device if it's on your device, and then switch back to the Cloud for whatever isn't on the device, now that would be cool. If I think of something to add, I'll come back to it. Cheers, Jerry"
"September 4, 2017","It is pretty good, but could be a little morw user friendly."
"June 13, 2017","Down loaded classic rock for my flight home from Seattle to San Francisco lay over 2hrs San Francisco to Reno. Thank goodness for my tunes."
"February 8, 2016","I love this service! So easy to use and a great selection of Prime Music, esp. as the Prime Music comes with a lyrics feature for some music. Would recommend this service. The only con was I unable to download the Amazon music player to my computer....I tried twice."
"November 1, 2016","I love Amazon Music, I listen to this almost every day"
"December 16, 2012","I found the product recently after purchasing some mp3s on Amazon, and the cloud server relationshipis fantastic! I like a lot of music and with my previous relationships with devices and porting my digital collections, I have had some consistant issues. This product is an awesome way for me to have access to my stored collections anytime anywhere a device is available, I highly recommend it, especially if you have ever bought the same song two or three times."
"October 22, 2017","It is so easy to navigate! I'm a senior and the selection is great. Amazon reccomends the best settings to help me save on my ""unlimited"" data. Thank you A😘"
"December 24, 2015","Love Amazon Music for free with Prime. Have been a member for a while and love watching the app grow! Must have for anyone with a Prime Subscription!"
"October 22, 2015","Great! Love it."
"February 3, 2016","Very useful"
"February 22, 2015","Amazing amount of music!! All with my Amazon Prime! Happy girl! !!"
"August 7, 2017","It's great. Need to get some ear buds."
"June 24, 2016","I love that I can download music and listen to it off line. The range of choice is fantastic!"
"June 14, 2016","Love the app. Enjoy the variety of music plus being able to use off line or the cloud. Great job"
"September 29, 2013","If you are have an eclectic ear for music, then amazon mp3 as what you need. I'll spin some Dylan; then turn around and Chick Corea will be pouring forth from the speakers before you even know what hit you in your ears. So, whether you live on the same musical diet each day or jump from John Coltrane to Shawn Colvin . . . you need to find the amazon mp3 app & click on ""Download."" Enjoy! Why? Because I am . . . ~ digheyseus (-on-the-upside-of-the-download)"
"January 23, 2015","I can't import my songs I just bought into any other music player. Waste of money to buy individual songs - now I know to just buy the whole CD so music is portable across all formats. UPDATED: It is possible to download the MP3 for portability and offline access, but you have to navigate through several screens to find it. It is convoluted and messy."
"July 15, 2015","I been using prime music for about a day or so and I love it. They have the music I love and I don't have to worry about stupid commercials. Also, it loads quickly which is great. I haven't had any issues with it thus far and find it user friendly. This will definitely be something I use to stream my music more."
"February 4, 2013","I'm unsure what I'm rating here... I buy all of my tunes from Amazon, the prices are usually fair, there's no DRM telling me what I can and cannot play it on or how many times I can listen to it before it disappears (iTunes and Wally World, for instance). I've also noticed that I can buy explicit (uncensored) music at Amazon, I absolutely HATE listening to a tune where they've chopped and butchered it to make it ""clean""!!! Not much ""storage"" space for things purchased in the past, so I store it on Google..."
"March 3, 2015","Love this app, can find my favorite music easily and most are available in prime membership!"
"October 30, 2017","Awesome Product great price"
"July 9, 2014","What can I say about the Amazon music app except that it Sucks! I buy songs individually from Amazon and download them to my Smartphone. But with this new app I can't tell which is on the cloud and which are on the device. It's geared toward Amazon prime music to which I do not subscribe. It needs a major overhaul! I liked the old app. It just worked but this new one sucks and blows at the same time!"
"July 19, 2015","I like the idea of saving songs to your playlist and downloading them for offline use. I feel though that there is less music than spotify and not nearly as friendly of a way the search the music."
"April 20, 2016","The keyboard cover was delivered on time and was beautifully thin. The ASUS keyboard cover fits and works well. It is thin, lightweight and does not impede keyboard sensitivity. Labelling is clear bright and big. Overall review: Wonderful!!"
"November 10, 2017","Love it."
"November 11, 2015","Works great"
"September 28, 2017","Great can find most music looking for"
"January 31, 2017","I have really been enjoying browsing through the stations. I'm using my Nexus phone a the source with a portable head phone amp driving HiFiMan 400i's The sound has been fantastic."
"December 2, 2015","Don't listen much but good"
"August 7, 2015","My experience of Amazon Music Prime is that it spends a lot of time not loading. I get to witness the little loading wheel going around and around for 5 minutes before being told that it can't load. The 3 stars are because when it does work, I love that I get so much musik included in my Prime Membership."
"May 10, 2016","The app keeps giving a 505 exception error and will not update. I have called customer service and they could not help even completed factory data reset on my Android device. The app itself is good but won't last long if I can't update"
"July 18, 2015","Its really great, I hooked right up to my phone and was really easy to figure out how to use it even without reading the instructions. The only issue I had was not being able to find a few songs or artists. The quality of music is awesome and k love that I can get most of the music free with my prime"
"April 17, 2016","It is a good player, but it keeps asking for an update and taking all day to install. It never installed because it took more than 24hrs and my phone usually ends up dying before ur even b begins installing (base was just yellow after downloading)"
"September 1, 2017","well ok"
"August 27, 2017","Great selection of music and no ads!"
"July 12, 2017","I LOVE YOU GUYS!"
"February 13, 2016","Well, one thing I can say is it certainly works much more smoothly than it used to, and the lyrics on-screen feature can be quite a bit of fun, and helpful, but the lack of features like Spotify's old Starred playlist (been awhile since I've been over at Spotify) and the fact that it is missing so many good, standard album tracks or that Amazon expects you to pay extra for them? Really? I'm sorry Amazon, but you need to do better than that to be considered a full-fledged music service. Search John Lennon and see how many results comes up: approximately 4 albums and one clearly appears to be by someone who is not him. Unacceptable. And this is only one example.  Amazon, come on. You can do better than that."
"August 10, 2017","The app is not user friendly. It seems like there is a different format every time I access it."
"March 2, 2016",".I had forgotten how much I enjoyed listening to music...they had all my favorites!"
"June 13, 2017","Sucks! A bad imitation of Pandora that promises music purchase and download ability yet makes it nearly impossible with a maze of hoops to jump through. The previous Amazon Music format was way better, wish all my music purchases hadn't been swallowed by some ringtone app..."
"June 18, 2014","They just made Amazon MP3 better! It goes well with my cloud CD collection I was able to add music I have in my physical collection (the 250 songs ran out fast) without buying it again or paying the subscription fee. It also allows you to try out new artists that your not sure weather or not you really want to buy them. I also found some alternate versions of songs from artist that I did not have prior."
"August 23, 2016","Music downloaded quickly. Sound was good quality from my Samsung Galaxy 6. Tunes available for free to Prime members were in a variety of genres and on top lists currently. Very happy with Amazon Prime music!"
"May 29, 2017","Didn't have the music I wanted"
"March 16, 2016","So far I love that I can stream endless music for free with my prime membership ad free ."
"February 5, 2016","I bought rascal flats ""Rewind"" and downloaded it. It took several hours to figure out where the song was saved on my sd card. Then I determined that it was saved as an m4a file type. I tried several file conversion apps to convert to mp3 - to no avail. I just want to listen to the songs I purchase - on an mp3 player when I go to the Doctor - which is VERY OFTEN.  I guess I will cancel amazon prime and go back to iTunes."
"December 2, 2016","App wouldn't load onto my MAC; worthless."
"June 27, 2014","Won't work on first generation Kindle Fire.  What's the point? It doesn't work on the first gen kindle fire so it is worthless to me."
"February 5, 2016","I absolutely love this album!!! Perfect music for all occasions. My favorite us ""To the world"", definitely a song to motivate you!! Looking forward to more dope music from Carlton Brown! !"
"October 5, 2016","It's okay. Have problems downloading songs at times. The worst thing is the search for specific artist, albums or single songs. Organization of the music list for the user, should be made easier."
"June 10, 2017","It's a music app and awesome for prime members"
"November 11, 2014","Compared to Rhapsody or Google Plus, the offerings are no where in comparison. Let down :-("
"August 20, 2015","I love amazon prime music so worth it to be a amazon prime member! You find music that is hard to find because it's old, and yet they have all the new music of today also, it's great!"
"January 31, 2014","I have no idea what MP3 is or stands for. A neighbor and I were calling up birds in the back yard with our phones. I know now not to do this..his phone was able to access more bird calls then mine and suggested adding an MP3 app to better my access to sounds/music. I can only hope it downloaded correctly to my phone from Amazon because I haven't had a use for it since. If I ever need an app, for my phone, Amazon seems to have them all."
"July 30, 2016","New to this service and still learning the ins and outs. So far,I think it's great. I'm evaluating under the trail prime. This is a plus for joining. I rated it a 4 star for now because I'm still learning about it."
"July 7, 2014","You have an internet connection. I downloaded a bunch of music but it won't play unless I have an internet connection, I wanted to be able to play my downloaded songs on road trips in between cell service but they won't play. Then there is the fact that you can only download songs to your phones memory and not an SD card, makes the 16 gigs of space I have available on my card pretty much useless"
"January 25, 2016","Not enough artists or variety in my favorite category; Stand-up comedy... Not able to use swipe action to advance to next track..."
"September 9, 2016","I used this app for many years and it worked great. I uploaded thousands of songs to the cloud and could play them back with no problem. I was a ""Power user"" according to the app. Then came the most recent update...I can no longer play the songs I uploaded to the cloud. I have reached out to Customer Service, but have not been able to get the issue reported correctly or fixed. Based on the reviews I have seen here, it seems I am far from the only one who has had this problem. If the app has received this many one star reviews in a short period and nothing is being done to fix it, it should tell us something."
"August 16, 2015","I love how you can watch the lyrics and you listen to a song!"
"May 16, 2015","I really like the music I selected from Amazon. I play the songs on my new cell phone, and they sound great!"
"December 3, 2013","Perfect app for phone.. Makes it so easy to download songs and store on my galaxy note 3 and also transfer and download to computer and put on cd or mp3 player."
"September 10, 2016","Love this, I download to my tablet and have coffee on the porch, in the very early mornings, with my favorite gospel classics. Being a Prime member, they have all been free. A special blessing, indeed!"
"May 15, 2016","I don't use it as much as I should seeing that if you pay for a Prime Membership, one should use the service. Thing is, that after you shut it off, the danged program keeps running in the background...just like the Amazon app and the Amazon Underground app. These apps are HUGE system and battery hogs.  Second, it's hard to find a specific album... let's say the Doobies Greatest hits and get it to save to your device. Next time, the danged app kicks up a recommendation instead and gives you ""playlists"" of groups similar to the Doobies. So I'll get my ""South City Midnight Lady"" and the next song will be some other artist.  Anyway, just the grumblings of an old geezer. :o)"
"June 21, 2016","Just got the app and love it! I'm a baby boomer and love the Beach Boys and hot rod songs."
"October 31, 2017","Great"
"January 26, 2016","Better than pandora iheart etc. highly recommend... can repeat song. no ads. as many skips as you want. make your own play lists. etc."
"April 10, 2015","Allows you to receive various songs at no cost if you are a prime member"
"October 15, 2016","Once app upgraded it will not work. Very disappointed."
"April 6, 2013","How excited I was to receive an e-mail about a month ago that all the albums I have purchased from Amazon over the years would be available in my Cloud Player - and accessible from my Android Phone. Apparently, April Fool's Day came early because I really believed Amazon. I have installed this app on my phone through both the Amazon app store and through the Google Play store and neither way works. I tap on the ""sign in to amazon"" button and....nothing. nada. So thanks Amazon - for nothing."
"December 5, 2016","I don't always use it, but it has a lot of songs I thought no one knew of (which are in the island reggae genre.) I appreciate the app and the access it grants to my favorite songs."
"December 30, 2016","You can only store 250 songs for free. Anything more than that would require you to pay the yearly subscription. There are plenty of other music library programs out there for free. Its unfortunate that after purchasing an Echo I cant take full advantage of it because I'm not willing to waste money on buying a music library."
"April 18, 2015","This service is similar to Pandora however however differs in that it works internationally. Advertisements that you get in the entry-level service to many free music services are not present in this application. Though I have not made purchases through the App, operation of the streaming stations is very simple and intuitive."
"June 18, 2014","Since Prime Music activated and my app was updated, I have not been able to access Amazon music on my phone. The following message pops up: ""The specified device could not be authenticated. Please try again. If the problem persists, contact Amazon customer service. Exception #45."" My phone is authorized on Amazon as well as my Kindle Fire and PC. Anyone else having issues on LG phones?"
"October 25, 2016","I am an Amazon Prime Member and I enjoy being able to listen to free songs. I find it arranged conveniently which is important to me as I am not a heavy listener. Too many other activities."
"February 5, 2016","I love having this app! It works great and its so nice to be able to listen to music that I pick out.. When compared to Pandora, this app far outweighs the benefits of having Pandora pick the similar songs for you..... I would definitely recommend this app"
"July 28, 2016","This app is great. You can find any music you want. It's not free for every song, but a lot are. You can also stream stations of genres of music you like, which is fun. Cool extra to having a prime membership."
"July 3, 2013","Basically iTunes for Android. I prefer the music player over the one the phone came with or any that I have downloaded."
"June 8, 2015","Not that easy to use. Crashes my samsung android phone. Player won't work properly on my Surface tablet. But, I actually do like having access to the music I have purchased as CDs as digital media. I also enjoy having access to some of the music Prime has available for no extra purchase. It works best on my PC."
"February 27, 2016","So far the selection of music is pretty good, lots of 50's and 60's Jazz. There are some issues between the my phone and Amazon music player but my other devices don't seem to have the same problem(s), otherwise I would have given Amazon five stars."
"April 22, 2016","Great app. I can't believe all the songs you can download for free. I have 389 songs and their all stored in Amazon's cloud so no matter how many I download, I'm not using any space on my device. It's worth every penny for $99.00 a year."
"August 1, 2012","i updated this today and didnt realize the slap in the face i'd receive. the previous policy was to buy an album in a year's time from amazon and your new amazon music and your old imported music could live happily ever after. not anymore. now they want a 25 dollar yearly subscription just to keep my already imported music on there. i love most of the things you do amazon, and this cloud player was previously my favorite. now instead of beaming about this service, which i have done for the past year or more, i will be expressing my extreme disappointment."
"June 2, 2017","Works great no complaints so far."
"November 5, 2017","love this app"
"September 17, 2015","I've used Pandora, Iheart radio, and Google Play. I like Amazon Music primarily because i can download for off-line use from a very extensive library but like the seamless play when streaming also. The user interface is simple but powerful. Amazon Music is now the only music app that i use."
"September 20, 2017","Best music app EVER!!!! Cancelled Pandora and Sirius and I HEART immediately!!!"
"October 30, 2017","A lot of music, they may not have the library Pandora has but I like it better."
"August 30, 2016","I love prime music because I can select all my favorite artists and songs into the library which can play the whole day. It is better than Pandora because there is no Ads. I think everyone should have it."
"October 30, 2016","Love this! I listen to music everyday from this!"
"May 17, 2015","This is a pretty decent streaming music player for my Amazon music content. I like that I can get channels with my Prime membership, but this app does not have a way to save favorite channels. It shows recently played channels, but that only gets in the way when you are experimenting. It really needs ""Favorites"""
"February 20, 2015","Great app, allows loading to my Note 4 seamlessly, because Apple has made it an incredible nuisance to transfer files from a Mac to Android phone. With every next generation of Apple product/upgrades they are ""jerks"" about alienating outside Apple products. When the life of my Mac is over, I'll never purchase another Apple product!"
"September 10, 2014","I started using this and thought I might enjoy buying some music from Amazon as I have in the past. I liked the seamless way it also downloads it to your device, but not the the internal memory!!!! WHY?!?!?! I will not be downloading any music or buying from Amazon, there's no point. I can get it elsewhere cheaper and import it myself. Fix this issue and I might buy more music."
"March 13, 2016",":P"
"July 24, 2016","Pretty good, just wish the searching process wasn't so complicated. If you don't know the actual name of the song or band you're looking for, it'll pop up A LOT of people you've never even heard of or don't like."
"November 13, 2014","This could be a great app, but the last update broke a lot of the best things about it. Hopefully Amazon will get it fixed pretty quickly. I use it on my Microsoft Surface to upload music to the cloud so that I can access it from anywhere.  Creating playlists has never been so easy! unfortunately the last update seems to have broken this great feature."
"September 25, 2014","This service is outstanding! No more scouring around grabbing potentially dangerous material from Pirate Bay, not to mention the endless hours taking all of that and making playlists! With Prime music, just create a playlist, open their pre-made playlists, and (with one click) save the songs/albums you want from theirs to yours and DONE! Amazon Prime is the shiz, period!"
"October 20, 2016","Never could get it work because it couldn't log in"
"July 25, 2012","This app used to be awesome. but now it wont play anything. slow refresh of playlists. hanging buffering. network errors.  I was buying my music through amazon but i'm going to go back to itunes and google drive/player.  I dont want an update to my phone to fix the problem. i want an update to this app. google play works fine. full streaming netflix works fine. youtube works fine. but amazon mp3 cant play a music file?  why would i buy an amazon android device (kindle fire) if they cant even get a streaming music app right?!"
"December 25, 2014","Took me some time to &#34;get&#34; how this worked. Once I lasted this minor issue I love Amazon Music. With my prime membership I get most of my music free to listen to. I love the prime playlists if you need a good breakup song they have a playlist of 50 all time greatest breakup songs!! I found many good recommendations too. Excellent app!!"
"February 10, 2016","Best music app I have ever used. Play any prime or purchased song anytime and anywhere even without service. Download any prime music for free and listen without streaming and without service of any kind. Actually listen to what you want when you want."
"May 16, 2017","Listen to it everyday I workout"
"June 18, 2014","First, thanks for making the music available. Ap works well enough if you can figure out how to make it work. I'm not a novice to these sorts of things and there are aspects of the user interface that are just not (and could be) intuitive. The player controls need some work (should be a Stop button)."
"April 28, 2015","...From my old phone that I downloaded & paid for many, as well, cuz ever since I switched phones(that I had to do because of a charger that I bought from Amazon), I have not been able to listen to because when I go to Amazon music & log-in, no tracks that were purchased using my previous phone come up!!!!! Wth Amazon?!?!?"
"September 14, 2016","works great to listen amazon prime music on my phone. Unfortunately, it also has various design flaws and UI hitches. Additionally, it is the only way to download amazon prime music for offline use."
"October 25, 2017","If I could rate this less than one star, I would. I already pay for Prime. I'm not paying for more. This is almost as bad as the video. I'll just get my music somewhere else."
"November 18, 2014","I have an LG G3 with the latest Android version. Unfortunately, I could never get this app to work. It would crash every time I attempted to open it, and when I tried to ""Submit a crash report"" instead of taking me to Amazon, it would just crash again. I had to uninstall the app, and then revert back to the version which originally came with my phone."
"May 8, 2017","Excellent ! I love it ! Great variety of genres! I'm currently working on my "" perfect"" playlist ! Thank you"
"December 30, 2015","I'm a huge fan of Amazon, but this app is awful. Give me a straightforward and easy way to download music to my phone. This is ridiculous!"
"June 20, 2014","It's a great music app, especially the Playlists packed with great songs. Not sure how much better being a Prime customer can be"
"May 14, 2015","Dear Amazon,  Exactly when are you going to get your I.T. personnel to fix the Amazon Music with Prime Music App? I'm sure you are well aware that the app has a major problem. It constantly crashes..."
"February 8, 2014","MINUS 1 STAR This was a ok App until this last up date...2 1/2 mabey 3 Stars. That was ok, just a mp3 player was all I was looking for. If you like the App DO NOT UPDATE TO VER: 3.0.5 I did and now regret it. App is glitchy and slows my phone way down, Also this version is connected to facebook ( don't need it) and I could care less if all my FB friends know what music I have on my phone. HOPE THIS IS HELPFUL"
"September 16, 2017","I have been pleasantly surprised by Amazon Music. Wide variety of artists, genre and songs. I'm glad this is another feature included with my Prime membership"
"October 17, 2016","continously getting error message...does not work"
"September 28, 2016","Unable to get any music to play on my device which is a blu selfie 2 phone i got from Amazon. Amazon always has great service so just would like to be able to get info on how to fix this issue."
"December 2, 2016","My go to music app it is awesome!"
"March 28, 2017","It is a good alternative to Spotify and the like, and it's good that a wide selection of music comes included with a Amazon Prime subscription."
"June 20, 2016","Hubby gets to listen to this during work. Loves the variety of music to choose from."
"May 11, 2016","I love Amazon Stations, I can always select what I am in the mood for and the station never fails me! Most of the music comes with lyrics on the screen, which is a huge plus for me who likes to sing along to songs I don't know."
"January 12, 2017","Seems so many people these days complain about everything. For those of you who complain about this app if you don't like the recent changes then uninstall the app and craw"
"June 6, 2016","Nice to not have the ads, but sucks that it stops playing on its own after about 5 songs."
"February 26, 2015","Love it and so easy to download on my Galaxy Note S3 phone."
"November 17, 2016","Love this app. Able to keep all my favorite music and play lists available to listen to on my phone. Playlist are categorized according to year/decade and genre...so simple to use."
"July 14, 2016","Great to not have to buy a download every time you find something new. Nice to find some older lp's of artist I already have on vinyl and cd. Makes it convenient to stream music via wifi to my home gym. Love it!"
"November 19, 2015","Works great but there isn't a very large selection of music or artist. If just listening to the mainstream artist and songs is good enough for you than so is this. The good thing about this is that there isn't a buffer or annoying load time between or beginning of songs"
"July 22, 2015","Convenient and the price is right."
"February 14, 2016","Not all of the artist I would prefer but a large selection of music. I have had issues with the Amazon player having static and cut out from time to time. Would prefer ability to use the phones media player but understand why that is not an option."
"June 6, 2014","WAY better quality than iTunes. Use it whenever I can and love the cloud. Download and use it, you will not be sorry."
"November 5, 2017","great selection works great!"
"April 28, 2017","Love it!"
"August 5, 2017","I love it! I think about a song and Amazon has it."
"August 4, 2015","Amazon Music works perfectly on my computer, on my phone, in my car as it connects from my phone and on my tablet. I am very happy with the way the selections are given and stored."
"September 12, 2016","not many good songs as I thought I get for free with Prime"
"November 23, 2015","Nice selections on mobile and desktop. However, the transparency of the playlist screen with album covers displayed behind it make it hard to read."
"August 16, 2015","I really like the music app! It was easy to use and had an endless selection, of a huge variety, of great music. I love the auto save to the Amazon cloud feature! Should I change my device, all there, easy.  Thank you for including Amazon Music with my Prime membership for free! Love it!"
"November 22, 2015","The app itself is getting better on mobile systems, but it kinda sucks on amazon fire TV. Super simple with not a lot of options to search music."
"November 3, 2014","All I wanted was to purchase one song on Amazon. To download it, had to log out, install this other 18mb (android) app, install updates, log in. Now the app runs constantly - mining god knows what data from my phone and: I can't Uninstall it? I do feel violated. Been a satisfied Prime customer for years, but Congrats: you just pi$$ed me off enough to drop it."
"March 25, 2014","I like to carry music with me and with this app I a can always have a song in my heart and also on my phone to enjoy anytime I chose."
"April 30, 2015","I use the Amazon Music app all the time on my computers and Android devices. The sound quality is appreciably better with Amazon Music on a PC than I can get with Pandora. Amazon Music doesn't have all of the music I want, but the ability to specify which song I want to play and to rewind or replay a song is useful."
"June 19, 2014","Not impressed at ALL. Music is hard to find, most of what I want to listen to I have to pay for even with a PRIME subs. XBOX music is superior in every possible way. Even the XBM Android app is better than this POS. VERY disappointed. Considering canceling my PRIME membership now since price increase and now this slap in the face. This should have spent another year in development, at least."
"August 20, 2016","The best music service for Christian music!"
"November 7, 2015","access to everything!"
"July 16, 2015","I like it, but it could do to have more music"
"January 25, 2016","5 stars if I could stop it from making itself primary. That role on my phone belongs to the audible app. Otherwise, I appreciate the ability to access music that I don't own yet. Give me more control over the app and I'd change this to 5 stars."
"July 15, 2016","Really wish they the interface was better made"
"December 4, 2015","I like the Amazon Prime Music service for a few reasons. They have a wide variety of artists to choose from and I can continue playing a song while I search for new music to play. The layout is pretty easy to use and their is an option to make your own playlists."
"November 21, 2016","Difficult to navigate when searching for a song. I wish the list of songs was m o recruiter inclusive. Not everything is on an album. Artists perform live and AM can be limited."
"April 18, 2015","Off to a great start but a sleep timer is a basic necessity."
"December 16, 2016","Does not work on all devices"
"July 18, 2017","Nicely set up, plenty to choose from."
"November 15, 2016","not a big fan of this version, previous one was more user-friendly in that layout was easier to navigate. But still love this app because it keeps all your purchases in one place"
"April 21, 2015","As we get comfortable with the service we're finding ourselves spending tokens amount of cash for great songs for the first time in a long time - and OK with it because of all the methods we can access that media. Perfectly OK supporting artists, things had just gotten crazy w/ the walled gardens over the last decade."
"September 12, 2014","I stumbled upon this benefit of Prime Membership. What a wonderful surprise. Easy to use all-around."
"January 18, 2016","I'm so disappointed. I started using Prime Music last week and it worked great. Then on Saturday it asked me to update Adobe Flash Player, which I did, but I still couldn't stream music. I continued to get the Flash Player error message. Tried rebooting, re-downloading, deleting Flash Player all together and trying again. Deleted my cache. Then tried again on Sunday. Still can't stream music. I give up."
"October 13, 2017","THE I-PHONE IS VASTLY OVER-RATED AS LONG AS YOU YOU HAVE THIS APP AND YOUR ANDROID PHONE! GET IT NOW AT AMAZON!!!"
"September 29, 2013","Hi Amazon people, i know this is part of your policies but i think its not fair to restrict songs shopping if you dont live in the US. some of us are loyal customers over the years and at least we deserve to be elected to pay for music if we wanted to. I hope things get better in the future. if i could buy mp3s and use your app this would be a rocking 5 stars review."
"May 10, 2016","I appreciate the fact that I can buy and download music I want, especially older music from the 50's as well as contemporary. I also appreciate being able to listen to music that I don't want to own, but enjoy on occasions."
"July 6, 2017","play more music"
"April 30, 2017","Never a problem. This application works great on all device"
"June 8, 2016","Too new to me to judge. I don't know the capabilities or how to navigate the service."
"July 19, 2014","Using this on my Android tablet (Hisense Sero7 Pro) which isn't ideal to use a ported and Amazon-modified Android app to begin with.  The free music offered under Prime membership is very very limited. I already have built up my paid collection thru iTunes. I would only recommend this service if you were building a collection from scratch and don't want to go with iTunes."
"August 7, 2017","very difficult to install"
"July 18, 2017","Love your music selection"
"January 18, 2013","The app restarts constantly,uses up unnecessary memory,slows/lags the phone making it freeze and choppy.Downloading songs to the phone is a pain...constantly have to uninstall app and reinstall to download music Ive bought. Its just a very bad app. Uninstalled it today and my phone works fine again...also uninstalled the Amazon Underground app-which is another horrible app as far as memory usage,restarting and lagging the phone. Im done with Amazon apps. Ill stick with Google music for my source of music."
"June 13, 2014","Amazon, you are pushing (nay, shoving) me into the open arms of your competition. Fire TV was supposed to be an all-stop media solution, and yet your own newest service is not available on it.  Otherwise, the app runs somewhat fine on Android (if you can deal with occasional crashes.)"
"October 5, 2016","Will not work keeps giving me error message #45."
"November 3, 2016","A quick and convenient means to an end...which is listening to music of my choice, on my terms.  As a bonus, most of the time, I get to read lyrics along with the songs!"
"December 18, 2014","I had forgotten this was included in Prime membership. I love it. Really enjoying the playlists and all of the recommendations for me are relevant and I do love them! Just when I want to complain about membership not being worth it, something else is added as a benefit and I have to shut my face. At least for me, I still enjoy my Prime benefits"
"June 12, 2017","Love it. Great selection of music."
"September 6, 2017","works quite well after running apps"
"August 21, 2015","Has all the music I love. Love the multiple options,streaming, buying etc"
"December 8, 2013","My Android tablet (HTC Jetstream) originated in Canada but is in use in the United States since it's purchase. This app is for the English language only if it is either United States or United Kingdom...NOT Canadian English. I'm sure it doesn't take a lot of work to add Canadian English to the list of recognizable languages. Since I cannot modify my device's language, my only hope is that someone at Amazon will fix this small-to-you-but-huge-to-me problem."
"September 30, 2016","More music than you will have time to listen too."
"June 20, 2014","I have ordered Amazon Music with Prime 4 separate times. It does not show up on any of my devices, specifically my Kindle Fire HDX. Cannot download music to my device. This should be more easy than what I am experiencing. Perhaps when I place it in my cart it should ask, ""What device do I want it placed in"". I cannot figure out how to get to where I can download music to my Kindle.  Perhaps its me, but I would think it would show up somewhere. When I go to the appstore I cant even find the Amazon Music with Prime music icon upon search."
"December 9, 2015","Nice idea horrible app fix the app instant 5 stars. My phone is where I most use Amazon Music but once it runs it constantly jams my phone"
"August 21, 2015","Love it so far. Plays a great mix of music & a wider variety than some of the other streaming music services out there. For people with Amazon Prime....this is a must have"
"March 16, 2017","Not as intuitive as Pandora."
"January 7, 2016","I want to like this but it's a huge pain in the butt. It duplicates every song that I downloaded for offline listening which doubles the space used on my phone. When I delete it all it just does it again 5 minutes later making it where I have no space for anything else"
"January 21, 2017","The in app search function will not find the same songs that the main site will locate. What the app lacks is made up by the excellent customer service Amazon provides."
"June 23, 2016","Love that I don't have any commercials to listen to in between songs. Awesome!"
"December 10, 2016","Great selection for Prime."
"June 7, 2016","It's okay for the most part but it's still lacking songs I really like I would rather go with spotify"
"March 22, 2017","Great music selection and easy to navigate. Exactly what I want."
"May 31, 2015","It is great to listen to the music that I like rather that what the radio station wants me to listen to along with there commercials. It is also great when I am out of range for good radio receptions. They offer many great pay lists that I have downloaded to my android phone to play on my truck Bluetooth."
"December 10, 2016","Great app  Shows lyrics highlighting text like a karaoke machine Good selection of songs. Especially if are prime customer you get to download songs"
"February 15, 2016","Still learning it.  I wish it could put my music into folders so that I can manage them better. Like all Christmas music in the Christmas Folder and not gumming up my lists.  The playlist builder is so simple and useful."
"June 6, 2017","My kids and I love Amazon music!!"
"August 31, 2015","I use the '80s Pop for Runners and Classic Rock for Runners playlists while walking with my dog in the park. I use Classics for Cleaning playlist to keep me motivated when cleaning my house. I am looking forward to exploring other playlists. It is very easy to download playlists."
"November 3, 2017","Cannot use my Prime membership on my Android Moto phone."
"April 20, 2017","Excellent app, just needs more non mainstream music lol."
"October 1, 2015","Good selection of music. However, with the app on my phone, the mojority of time it doesn't connect and just spins while attempting to load. I can search, view and see the music but much of the time the music never starts. So, I go to pandora or slacker radio for my music."
"March 28, 2017","Great list selection!!"
"December 8, 2016","This app is absolutely terrible...I don't know why it was even created... just a total waste of time because it's not a music app they have more adds then anything else"
"February 17, 2016","I use it all the time! If you have amazon prime you have access to playlists, and radio stations. A near unlimited resource of ""free"" music (i say ""free"" because you pay for your amazon prime membership) at your finger tips!"
"June 8, 2016","better than google play. allows you to download to device and play off line so long as you are prime. good selection of tunes. can play on several ios and android devices."
"November 22, 2015","Nice, neat, easy to understand interface. A fairly good collection of music. A Great addition to Amazon's growing number of quality services."
"January 23, 2016","I love having this application on my phone, there is a lot of excellent music available that comes free with Amazon Prime."
"December 9, 2016","After IHeart radio started having loading issues while I was in the gym I quickly downloaded Amazon music and haven't looked back Great options and easy to use- thanks"
"October 4, 2017","The shiznit"
"August 3, 2017","No commercials or advertising promo - Keep doing it...."
"December 27, 2016","Wow! Who needs any other Music App! I am very impressed and have stopped using iHart Radio and pandora. I see it even replacing iTunes. I love it! -J"
"February 20, 2015","I find AMAZON music app as a whole very very good, its unfortunate that even with prime - it relies on 4G connectivity (unless others know differently) even if the prime free music is downloaded locally - not everywhere there is wifi access. I still recommend it because of the selections and extensive musical tastes supported."
"September 7, 2016","One great perk for Amazon Prime. Prime lets you download or cloud many great selections of music artists all for FREE. I say free because we use Prime's free shipping at 99.00 a year. Bravo"
"June 4, 2016","Just getting startrd using prime music. Works great, I really like the playlists."
"May 6, 2016","Love this part of Amazon prime. All my songs in one place and easy to use. I am a music freak have always loved music. Even my 1 year old daughter seems to love music so our favorites are one click away now."
"November 26, 2015","great to have!"
"May 16, 2016","probably one of the best subscription based music services out there and the diversity is bar none one of the best I have ever seen. As a music Producer/DJ it's good to have so many options to listen to in the cloud."
"July 20, 2017","The sound is very clear. There are many selections to choose from & others I can search for to add to my music library."
"June 12, 2016","Well I just started using Amazon music prime but so far I really do like it !!"
"June 1, 2017","love it!!"
"September 25, 2016","Shane, resolved all my issues, he was very patient, and knowledgable, did everything to help me . My tablet is great and my music is back the way, I like it, wonderful representative."
"May 25, 2017","does not have a lot of old music 60,70,80s. will probably cancel subscription"
"July 21, 2017","I can't download it on my phone lost all my music that never downloaded onto my ad card How can a s 7 galaxy not be compatible. Amazon u lost a good customer"
"April 19, 2016","Fabulous! I've been using Pandora and Spotify, only to be interrupted by commercials, hear many repeat songs and no ability to pick specific artists, albums and songs...as an Amazon Prime member I am loving Prime Music!!!"
"June 22, 2014","Amazon Mp3 worked great on my Nook HD+. This ""upgrade"" crashes into an infinite loop forcing me to cycle power."
"July 19, 2015","Finding all kinds of music I have never heard before and enjoying it all greatly. A special surprise I found was a group, or should I say person, called Skrillex. Its all dubstep but some of the songs are highly thought provoking. One song has even been added to my all time favorites list."
"March 15, 2015","Honestly my dad was telling me how cool this perk is when you have prime, I finally got to checking it out a month ago, and love it!, no more Pandora, I can put whole albums from so many artists in my library and just list away. Plus cool playlists can added and listed to, very easy to use, and definitely check it out"
"November 11, 2016","Does not work on PC. After 10 hours of downloading nothing played or download. Where is the support? iTunes is a horrible this maybe the only software that maybe as bad."
"May 22, 2016","I had always used this on my phone but now everytime I click it, it says get Amazon music for Android it takes me to this page then I click open it repeats. It doesn't work for me at all. Doesn't work for Android."
"August 28, 2017","why 500 songs playlist limit?"
"May 14, 2017","Downloaded in error...my bad."
"November 8, 2015","For some reason, it does not play on my Android devices. The loading icon (little orange circle) just rolls around and nothing happens. But then my Amazon Echo can tell that I'm trying to play something. It's very frustrating especially since I'm paying for it."
"February 16, 2016","Dislike dislike, you are allowed to tie it to your phone, but I am one who likes to customize my device with new ROMs and so it locks out Amazon Music for 177 days each time.. Stupid, it should be tied to the account and not a device..."
"May 7, 2016","Well, to make this fair... I love this app and prime music! I have had SAT radio for years, I accepted it for what it was. I don't have to any longer. My SAT radio always had a ""tin"" quality to the audio, but prime music is clear and amazing. I own a new F150 and have turned on the SAT only a few times. It's just as easy for my phone to automatically connect and start streaming. It sounds so much better. Choices, choices... Streaming stations, my library, or prime music that is usually available with my subscription! It's all there, in one place. You wouldn't think of writing a check for expensive, poor quality products, would you? So, stop feeding the SAT company. Prime is where it's at! Best of the best!!!"
"February 28, 2016","This app is very user friendly, but there is not as much selection as other apps I have used. I will continue to use this app with my prime service over others that are relatively expensive. Overall great choice for those with prime."
"January 22, 2017","This app is great. Understand though, that the music you download is for ""trial"" not permanent. The songs last a long time but will disappear eventually."
"May 5, 2016","We have ALEXA and Prime goes with her wonderfully. We especially like all the music we can listen too with all our favorite artists. Lots and lots of playlists available too. Plus, the free two day shipping is nice."
"January 6, 2017","Not enough selection"
"October 14, 2016","I absolutely love this app! Provides access to an enormous collection of music old and new. Gives you the ability to create play lists of all your favorite music and then some."
"March 30, 2016","Very easy to use. Great choices in many music genres. I listen for a few hours every day and whenever I think of a rock or country song or singer from my youth I look it up and almost always find it and add it to my playlist."
"August 17, 2016","Music is old and does not keep up with iTunes or spotify"
"July 23, 2015","Best app out there for album purchases. I've set this as my default music app. It had an amazingly smooth ui, and flawless playback. I can't say enough good things about it."
"December 3, 2013","The app works well and I would have given it five stars if not for one minor music preview contention. While listening to the short clip (usually after about ten seconds) of a song one is considering adding to the collection it is sometimes unresponsive to switch to another song. Mind you this is not an issue for songs on the device, only those one might navigate through in making choices about new music to add (purchase)."
"September 2, 2016","Have to have internet to play the songs you bought."
"April 21, 2016","Love Amazon music. Took me a while to use as part of Prime subscription but wish I had been using since day 1. Have been streaming lots of great albums from my youth. Tremendous selection of artists and albums available."
"October 8, 2016","I downloaded this n it doesn't work..:-("
"September 14, 2016","Great app. Music, photos,movies,now more movies.."
"November 26, 2016","I sing more now. Sometimes I even dance more now. I'm so happy to have Amazon Music. I can access this from anywhere and download my music to my phone. I love it."
"September 5, 2016","Awesome app!!! It's still missing a few songs here and there, but I know They'll get it together soon. Need more like ""Pirulo y La Tribu"" music and some more like that in there."
"September 16, 2017","Enjoyed"
"July 5, 2015","Not a lot of music. Seems there are quite a few artist but if you are looking for their big albums those aren't availablen, I have also noticed a lot of cover band... really"
"June 13, 2014","This needs to go back to the programmers ASAP. It crashes constantly locking up my Galaxy Note 2 to the point I have to a battery pull to reboot.  It's NOT intuitive at all. Clunky to navigate.  I'll try again in gew more builds. For now I'll keep paying for Spotify."
"July 24, 2015","I used I heart radio but always found it skipping or pausing during a workout that stinks, Prime Music is awesome very reliable and I don't have to deal with it freezing up."
"August 28, 2017","Wow it's fantastic I can listen 2 any mediation I want I alrady have a library I love it."
"August 26, 2016","Glad to have Amazon Music on my computer, but the interface is not good. It's much harder to browse artists and albums on the PC app than on the phone one. No problems otherwise, though."
"August 30, 2016","I am very happy with Amazon Music. I use it with my Amazon Echo device and it plays the stations or play lists i command. Amazon Music has a very large selection of music to choose from."
"August 6, 2015","I love my Amazon Music. I can't believe I went so long without utilizing this great Prime member advantage. I absolutely love the stations and best of all ZERO ADS !!!!"
"September 29, 2017","It was on my phone, then suddenly it disappeared. I've tried installing it more than once, but I get ""download pending"" in the app store."
"February 14, 2013","Installing Cloud Player and amazon MP3 player was my first excursion into putting music on my smart phone, which I, not being a digital native, was apprehensive of attempting; however, I could not resist the idea of getting something for nothing...so I timidly proceeded. I now feel like a bonafide ""tech-pro""! It was easy, and I love having my favorite songs at the mere swipe of my finger. In addition, the sound is amazingly ""rich"" for such a small device. Thanks, amazon!"
"June 21, 2016","I thought there would be more music to stream but its only select songs."
"October 20, 2016","Does not have alot of the new songs"
"April 27, 2016","Not bad, but has no equalizer. This alone is very disappointing. Amazon offers a free equalizer app for Android, there is no reason for not having one as part of this product that I'm paying for with my prime account."
"January 18, 2017","Usually has the music I'm looking for and I have some very specific song choices. The stations unfortunately to be repetitive so you end up changing them alot."
"July 23, 2016","I can't get Amazon Music on my Kindle any more. What happened?"
"April 29, 2015","I can't believe what a great value Amazon prime is. For less than $10 a month I not only get free shipping with Amazon's satisfaction guarantee, I get tons of free tv AND free music. If I want something particular that isn't prime I can purchase it at a good price. And no contract! What more do you want?"
"July 10, 2017","It doesn't work."
"June 26, 2014","It used to be a workable app, but pushing prime up front makes it a pain to just listen to music on my phone. I tried one &#34;Prime&#34; song today and it played ok, but if I paused or tried to switch songs it didn't respond, then after several tries it would perform the actions I'd tried in order sometimes 20+ seconds apart, so the track would go back to the start and play for a little while and start over, then it would play a little and switch to the previous track, then after a bit the track before that. Then about 6 hours after I first got the &#34;Prime&#34; song I tried to play it again and the app said it was no longer available, then removed it from my list. Lame! Plus since this is such a big overhaul of the app it shouldn't have the benefit of a couple of years worth of 3, 4 and 5 star reviews. This makes me think twice about even listening to my own music because I don't want the frustration!"
"August 30, 2015","Improved product since installing once before several months ago. Easier to use. Can't figure out how to force to stop running in the background. Also, once you're listening to music, can't ""turn off"". Only pause. Don't need the ram hog and overheat my phone. Note 4."
"February 18, 2017","More should be free for prime"
"February 23, 2015","clunky interface. limited products to choose from. Don't bother"
"August 22, 2015","Love the music! Better than Pandora.In fact I dropped my XM Raido account because Amazon Music plays the music I want to hear and cost less than yearly XM account."
"September 3, 2016","love this music app.....has every song i look for even the hard to find song. I love how easy amazon music is set up and easy to get around. I listen to music all day long and this music site is #1!"
"November 3, 2012","This app continues to suck, now it won't play the sample tunes. I kept using it since my info was stored on amazon for non- dloads and they have a paymeent system The MP3 app is SO So Lame, this app sucks and so does the tech support. Of course they set it up to make it easy to dload stuff you don't even want. You'd think Amazon would invest some money in tech support to keep their vending machine taking in money. Lame, find another one."
"January 24, 2016"," "
"October 16, 2017","I like the music selection"
"June 21, 2016","Absolutely love our Amazon Music!! We can play all our music anywhere!"
"July 17, 2015","Sounds good, but it would be nice to see the bit rate quality. Able to find lots of music, but would like to see a Pandora like random music when looking for an artist. Also it seems the only music available for hip hop genre is explicit, making it a bit difficult to listen in public."
"January 14, 2014","Before the latest Android upgrade it worked great. After that, most of the songs in my playlists dissappeared. The only way I was able to recover was by recreating those playlists from scratch. Note to engineering, need to test your product with new OS releases ahead of the release. I'm guessing this problem will be resolved in future Android updates. Nonetheless, that's a bit of a dissapointment."
"May 2, 2017","Excellent Music"
"June 19, 2014","The app doesn't allow you to play a Prime playlist without first copying it into your library. The only thing you can do with one without copying it into you library is listen to samples. I'd much rather listen to the whole thing (perhaps skipping songs) and then copy it to my library if I like it. There are too many steps and too many delays in the current implementation."
"April 29, 2017","Good music variety but songs cycling out of my playlist from time to time is irritating"
"August 12, 2017","I love the music thank you very much."
"October 16, 2016","Wonderful, awsome , great, I have everything on my amazon music. I have everything from my 90s alternative to hank williams 3. I can't tell you how much I love amazon music."
"June 16, 2014","I use o be able to enjoy my music thru out my house on my Sony devices but now you have taken it away why? I DON'T HAVE AN I phone! so I don't get to listen to music anymore. so what's the point?"
"January 12, 2016","This is all about David Bowie right now.  Amazon did a great service in making sure Black Star was listenable for free. I'll grant that. They didn't have to, and that's a credit to them.  But given that he'd just died, maybe for a few days you could have put his Greatest Hits up for free? Because honestly it feels like a cash grab otherwise. If I now want to listen to Bowie I've got to buy it from you? Yes I know music is commercial, but this is a free music service we're talking about here.  I'll gladly shell out for Bowie's greatest hits - a day or two or a week from now. Right now? Might you not have just done a service to fans and put some stuff up for free? For a few days, and then ended it? Wouldn't that have been the high minded thing to do?"
"February 3, 2016","I would like to down load my music to my phone so that I could listen in the car without using my data but when I am at home it is wonderful Bluetooth to my diffuser in the bathroom while I am getting ready for work or soaking."
"September 9, 2014","amazing benefit od Amazon Prime membership - free music, can download."
"January 31, 2017","It could be a little more user friendly and more selection of music from certain artist but other than that it connects in places where the other ones don't."
"March 2, 2016","Compared to some other offerings available I think this is good value for money; especially as it covers more than one area of entertainment.  I assume the music side will grow as there are quite a few gaps at present."
"October 26, 2015","love my music"
"May 3, 2017","Can't compete with I heart I heart's way better"
"June 8, 2015","I'm having trouble with songs not downloading properly. So I lost the ability to listen to them on my device. It thinks theyve already downloaded, but they didn't. :( Not very happy about that, because I can only listen to them when I have access to wifi because I don't want to use up my data."
"January 29, 2016","Do not really like the layout. So an my android phone I just move the files to Folder Player music player. I love Folder player it is not overdone with needless designs and features. Want to improve this player check out Folder Player."
"October 3, 2017","very very good"
"September 2, 2016","LOVE this song and artist. The whole album ""Outlaw"" is amazing...and he has a new album you can download or get on preorder from his website ""Retro""...mines ordered 😊"
"July 18, 2016","We love it. If it's on prime you can download it on to your device. Which is good so you don't have to use your data. They don't have every song, but they have alot. You just have to search."
"March 11, 2016","For some odd reason this app keeps closing when I'm using it. Please fix this. I'm paying for this."
"July 20, 2016","Worst music app ever made. I only get it for the prime music"
"May 31, 2017","Songs would either cut out early or they would complete and then repeat."
"August 15, 2014","SWEET Music. Oh my ! I never new how many perks came with Prime. I'm truly excited and it's really important now with our economy to belong to a Online community like Amazon. I have saved hundreds of dollars in shipping and gas from my membership. My grandson loves the movies and I just learned about the music! Sweet I've added almost 500 albums to my library."
"June 15, 2014","I like to use my tablet while docked (horizontally) - This app only displays in portrait mode. I like to send my music to my surround sound system via my Chromecast - forget that with this app. I guess I just have to use Google Play."
"January 8, 2015","It is impossible to play a &#34;prime&#34; song that is downloaded to my device. It actually causes the whole app to force close when trying to play such a song. I have contacted customer support to no avail and I've seen many other people with the same issue so I know it's not just my phone. I wish they would fix it."
"March 18, 2017","Love this app"
"July 26, 2016","amazon prime video is incompatible with my Android TV box."
"February 9, 2016","For some reason I can not get it to link with my Echo. It shows songs are in Amazon prime for free yet they won't play. I do like buying my music from the service. The down loading and moving music to my 2 devices works with ease."
"December 18, 2016","Great variety of various types of music, vocals, instrumentals, classic, country, rap, show tunes. You name your listening pleasure & you can find it here."
"December 21, 2015","Needs smart playlists, play counts, etc. Not advanced enough - have the designers seen iTunes? As this pales in comparison."
"March 15, 2015","Please add a recently added tab to ""My Library""  Added a photo illustration.  on a plus side, it is so much faster and easier to use then when it was introduced a few years back."
"June 18, 2014","My samsung tablet its a different story. The dowload has some bugs in it my tablet shuts down and will not turn on again I must do a reboot to get it back on line the app keeps loading and will not complete the download. As soon as I uninstall the app from my tablet everything goes back to normal. Like I mentioned previously works great on my Samsung phone...go figure"
"June 5, 2016","It works for playing music, but isn't that great for international music."
"September 12, 2017","Hello there yes I give a 5 plus I enjoy the music and I was pleased that I was able to select my own music with I enjoy to listen to and I thank you Amazon"
"June 14, 2016","use this more than other sites now, my play list with out interuptions"
"May 3, 2017","Love this app I use it for my workout at the gym & when I run Thank you much!!!"
"February 24, 2013","Like most of Amazon's apps, this has a nasty tendency to crash at times when you really don't want it to. There are other, free, players online that work far better."
"May 31, 2015","We're using Amazon Music/Prime Music with our Amazon Echo and it works great! Love all the freeplay of so many songs that can easily be added to our music library with one click."
"November 1, 2016","It won't work on my tablet!"
"July 14, 2016","We have this linked to our alexa & our soundbar at home -it's our GO TO versus Pandora lately. THey have stations and offerings that pandora does not!  We LOVE everything Amazon!"
"June 12, 2016","I have a free month of Amazon Prime and I TOTALLY am loving the music!"
"October 25, 2015","It takes forever to sinc to this app. I'm streaming off my phone, and if you interrupt the music to take a phone call, or pause the music for whatever reason, you'll be staring at that little download arrow for several minutes before the music starts again."
"May 7, 2017","Enjoying it very much, anything I could think of listening to is available plus a wide range of other features."
"July 25, 2016","I love this> First time I've used any site for music and this is a great place for that. I was a DJ for many years and I would have loved to have this this then. Thanks Amazon! You rock!"
"April 27, 2014","Amazon MP3 is the best audio player I have tried for android devices. One issue I have with the application is that you cannot place the app on your SD Card. The second problem is turning off the program. The only way I could find would be to go into settings after “pausing” the player, and pressing ""Clear Player."" If Amazon could resolve these concerns, I would give 5 Stars."
"June 5, 2016","Very easy to use with the ability to download whatever songs you'd like!"
"October 24, 2015","Loved the play list it created from the songs I liked without me having to mess with it during my workout. Kept me moving with no commercials & I didn't have to pay anything for a station created for me. Will definitely keep using this app on a daily basis."
"December 4, 2016","My favorite service. One of the very best services available! Has the ability to customize and create playlist with a large variety of music to choose from. Love it!"
"May 31, 2017"," "

"June 6, 2017","Good things"
"July 23, 2015","I love the variety and the selection!!! Worth purchasing PRIME"
"July 17, 2016","Great app, but would be even better if it were true when it tells me ""Okay, we'll never play that song again"" when I rate something a thumbs-down. Other than that, it's pretty decent."
"June 5, 2016","Easy to find the exact music I'm looking for.. really like the app"
"September 25, 2016","Its great, i uploaded my music to the free amazon libraty thing and i can access them from anywhere but if i could control the amazon echo from there then it would be perfect"
"July 29, 2016","I love Amazon Music! I listen to it a lot when I'm on my laptop. Yes, there are songs I wish were on here, but you can't expect any music service to have each and every song ever recorded."
"January 7, 2017","The issue is with my Samsung tablet. It downloads, music screen comes up with choices, but after I hit the play button, the songs starts but NO sound..."
"July 1, 2017","Pretty good selection"
"June 27, 2016","LIKE IT, BUT IT SPOT WORKING WHEN YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO WIFI."
"August 12, 2017","Just love it im a plain and simple kinda person. And nothing complicated about it and haven't found a song yet that Amazon does not supply"
"July 18, 2017","best music"
"October 2, 2017","Great App!"
"July 30, 2014","Excellent selection of music for FREE! I like the music mixes. I will continue to use this service"
"March 12, 2015","I have it downloaded to my desktop and it never seems to work properly anymore, even when assuring updates are all completed. I will select a song from a playlist created and it will never stop. Truly irritated, because it was not always this way. It was once my only source for streaming music from my laptop."
"March 14, 2016","This is a Great benefit of Prime! I like Country music and there is a lot of country music to choose from. Of course there is also Many other types/genres to choose from. Much of the music can be downloaded to listen to."
"October 14, 2014","I really wasn't sure what rating to apply to prime music, so I settled with it's just OK since the app is not all that bad (lacks some more advanced features and is pretty basic, but works well on my Android tablet) and I have no problem streaming music from the Amazon servers. The issues I have would get one star for each one, but overall I'd have to stay with 3 stars.  Issue #1 - no sd card support. I did download most of my prime music to my Android device, but had to take it off my and rely on the cloud because I couldn't move the prime music to my sd card and it was filling up my internal device storage. So if no wifi available, can't play any prime music, but that's OK because I do have plenty of other music on the sd card of my tablet.  Issue #2 - not all albums appear to contain the original recordings.This is a bit odd and completely unexpected - it seems that at least some of the albums are NOT the original recordings of the album. Some of them I actually had the original record or cassette years ago which I played incessantly. Of course, these are long gone and it was good to find them on prime music...BUT I absolutely know what is on prime music is not exactly the original. It is the same songs, but they have been redone in a different style...almost like they were cuts that didn't make the original final album. I have found 2 instances of albums like this and I'm sure there are many more. Disappointing."
"September 25, 2015","Just started using it... I like it so far"
"April 28, 2017","Just wish it had more Disney movie songs or sound tracks for the kids. But otherwise love it :)"
"October 15, 2015","This App is my music go to! It has never failed me, always there with a new playlist, album or single. It is the way I start most mornings & an endearing friend during a long work day! It rocks, sways, jingles & pulses with me whatever the mood I am in!!"
"February 9, 2016","I love the ability to choose ""my"" music and download it on my I phone for listening in my car, motorcycle or whenever I please. The options of Amazon Prime with free 2nd day shipping, music and video choices are awesome."
"April 25, 2016","I love the Amazon Music. I listed to it while at work and while on the road. I will stay on Amazon Prime just to have the music, movies and shipping. I end up shopping more but I love it for the convenience."
"August 12, 2016","The app is great. The music library is a but thin"
"June 20, 2016","I like it beacuse i can hear all the new music where ever i want."
"July 22, 2017","great app"
"October 29, 2016","Best music app I've used."
"August 3, 2012","I bought a Nexus 7 and planned to install a couple hundred music files from my Amazon Cloud account. Upon attempting to download 10 files from Amazon Cloud, I was presented with a message ""Linux only allows one file to be downloaded at a time. Please checkmark only 1 file and try again.""  Does that mean my entire Amazon Cloud library must be downloaded to my Nexus 7 one file at a time? How Neanderthal! I know I can stream Amazon Cloud music files, but streaming is not available when traveling the subways."
"March 21, 2014","This is a fast easy to use app that brings music right to your phone. I love being able to download the music onto my phone instead of transferring it from PC to phone. I also love that your purchases are saved in the cloud. Everyone knows how frustrating it is when your phone goes crazy and you lose everything. With this app you can put it right back with a few simple steps. It's great."
"May 17, 2016","Not enough music. Very poor competition to others like spotify for example."
"August 10, 2016","Way better than iTunes. Switched to amazon almost 10 years ago and I have bought my music exclusively from them ever since. I have an iphone and I use amazon music player never itunes"
"September 26, 2016","I absolutely love the convenience of amazon music. The awful thing about streaming music is you normally have to pay an arm and a leg for the music you want and if you don't like to listen to the same stuff over and over it's not really worth it to me. The other streaming sites that are free you don't get to chose what you are listening to. Normally you get to pick a station and they chose what songs come on. With Amazon prime music you get to chose what you listed to. There are songs included with prime and some you have to pay for. The amount of songs that are included with prime is enough to listen to so buying a song here or there isn't a problem. Especially, when you make a prime purchase and chose no rush shipping you get a dollar credit for digital purchases. I LOVE IT."
"August 11, 2017","I love it!! Make playlists for my 5 mile walks. Works great even a grandma can easily use it."
"December 29, 2016","i love using it on the computer as just a music player. the only thing i wish it had was a sick visualizer animation option to go along with the music."
"July 29, 2014","It is skipping/stuttering music that has been downloaded to my device. It spins continuously instead of actually playing music streamed from the cloud. It quickly consumes resources on the device to the point that I have to restart the device to gain back control."
"October 17, 2016","Did not ask for it and do not know who authorized purchase. Only thing good was it was free. If it was automatic due to 30 day free trial of Prime, then it should say so. This way, people do not think their account has been breached."
"June 14, 2016","Happy, happy with my Prime subscription that include Amazon Music."
"February 27, 2015","I love having amazon prime music, the only request I have for the app is the ability to set a standard page for when you open the app. It always defaults to the album list but I want to be able to set it to the artist list. I've looked around and couldn't find a setting to change. Otherwise great job guys!"
"June 4, 2015","Looks like a great Product !"
"February 23, 2016","Prime music is a must have!! Love the feature where you can download as much music as you want to listen offline so you can save on data (if you don't have unlimited)!! Cloud feature syncs right to my computer, LOVE IT!!!"
"November 10, 2016","As a prime user it has a lot of music to choose from. I've always found what I'm looking for. I also like the fact that I can listen to a huge Playlist offline."
"March 11, 2015","App looks great and seems intuitive. Why 3 stars? No option to move cached prime music (downloaded for offline listening) to external SD card. Instead the app fills up valuable space on your internal device storage with encrypted media files. I'm not sure why they do this. It can't be for copy protection since anyone can easily copy the cached music (m4a files). The files are encrypted and useless without playing them through the app as designed.  Other major problems: - no automatic volume normalization. Who wants to constantly turn the volume up and down with every song? - ""preview album"" function for listening to music I would potentially buy doesn't work reliably. I have to amazon.com through a browser and preview there. - Cannot read reviews of songs/albums. It shows how many stars and how many reviews, but does not take you to any reviews if you try to click on them"
"September 7, 2017","First few songs it would play, but after that it sucks"
"March 2, 2016","I love this option for music as there have even been some new releases that are available. Do have a challenge keeping the whole album going when I play it in the car though. Not sure what the genesis of that problem is."
"November 30, 2013","Love, love love this app. I just purchased cordless headphones, and I walk around in my home without checking every few minutes, as with Pandora. I have my own songs on the player."
"July 21, 2014","I LOVE AMAZON, HAVE HAD PRIME FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND GLAD TO SEE THEY ARE TAKING OVER THE WORLD HA HA LOL. LOVE THE AMAZON FIRE STREAMING DEVICE, AND MAY GET THE AMAZON PHONE AFTER A FEW MONTHS AND OR GOOD REVIEWS OR POSSIBLE BUG FIXES. I AM OFTEN AMAZED AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT AMAZON PRIME --- WHAT NON WORLD ARE THEY EXISTING IN?!"
"June 19, 2016","Good music source, great variety, current and legacy collection."
"January 6, 2015","I recently downloaded &#34;cleanmaster' app, which tells me this app is constantly restarting itself in the background and draining battery, slowing down my device. I don't listen to music on my phone that often, guess I will have to delete it. That is disappointing, because I am a long time Amazon Prime customer."
"December 24, 2014","Amazon music and in particular Prime Music has been great for me. I love the selection, the ease of use, the ability to download songs to my Kindle Fire HDX for the times when Wi-Fi isn't available, album covers & lyrics, and pretty much everything else about Prime Music. Thanks for yet another benefit of Prime membership."
"August 10, 2016","Love all the free music that is available with Amazon prime. Also love that I can still play music on my phone using the offline library when I'm not in a service area or near Wi-Fi."
"February 20, 2015","I love the fact that this is available, but it's been quite a learning curve for me. Maybe I'm just a bit slow when it comes to music-related programs, but it drives me crazy sometimes when trying to upload/download my own music. But when I get it, it's AWESOME. I love being able to play my music from anywhere."
"September 29, 2016","I love the selection that you get"
"July 19, 2017","Lots of songs available. But a lot not available for free listening. Easy playlist creation."
"May 9, 2017","Works awesomely. Has all the songs I've been wanting, and easy to download. The price per month is very reasonable too."
"July 31, 2012","Installed update on working MP3 install on Nexus 7. No longer works. Hangs on continue. Moto Droid X2 updated OK, so has an issue with the tablet."
"June 24, 2016","It would be 5 stars if it would allow me to update on my phone"
"October 22, 2016","Although i really love the options. I really don't like how my music IA automatically rearraned and songs are played that I didn't purchase or select through prime."
"March 2, 2015","Great music, no problems so far."
"June 7, 2016","Goes well with Echo, just about any genre you'd want. Outstanding!"
"October 12, 2016","I love this benefit of Prime membership! Free music, what's not to like?! If you have the Audible app, you can also listen to free audiobooks on ""Channels""."
"November 22, 2016","Thought this what you use to stream music with my prime acct I thought this was included with prime and was surprised to see you trying to charge me for it."
"August 6, 2015","I love it. Its better than Pandora. Only complaint is sometimes its difficult to navigate when trying to find certain things but im sure they'll iron this out."
"April 26, 2016","Fabulous! I work out with prime music every day..love the stations, what ""we are listening to"", etc. I am hooked on it, in addition to being such a good value along with free shipping, movies, etc."
"November 21, 2016","Not downloadable"
"November 15, 2013","Good product and easy to listen clearly. And the most important thing is free. So take it now and enjoy the music."
"August 5, 2013","It said I could get mp3's of some music I had previously bought from Amazon, and it said it went to get them and downloaded them for me, and even showed me a list of artists that made sense as I had bought all those artists, but nothing was actually downloaded and my song list is empty. I'll come back and try it again sometime maybe when it works properly."
"February 9, 2017","If you have prime membership...go for it...get all that free music...it's worth it...I'm frugal...so go crazy & download, download, download & enjoy!"
"September 28, 2016","Everything Work the way it said."
"February 16, 2016","I love Amazon music ten times more than the mac-based music. Their app is user friendly and there is plenty to choose from. Once again, thank you Amazon for having a phenomenal alternative to other, more popular music apps."
"June 15, 2016","Love being able to listen to songs and artists anywhere anytime."
"June 14, 2016","Excellent music selection. We can even download for offline use."
"November 15, 2016","Can access Amazon Music on all my non-Amazon devices, but unable to stream on my 4 year old Amazon Kindle Fire HD7!!! Seems to be a bit of an own goal here."

"April 30, 2017","Seems to we work pretty good"
"July 29, 2016","Very good app. I have had no problems what so ever"
"April 3, 2016","Simply amazing. Ive been a prime member for years but finally switched from a KF HDX to a samsung tab as the fire tablets after the 3rd gen HDX became low cost budget tablets more so then they were. The app though offers a lot for prime music members and is very user friendly. Works perfectly on any device. Its even slightly easier to navigate then the inherent music app on the kindle devices themselves, due to an update on those devices that makes it more difficult to switch from online to offline downloaded songs. Great app! P.s - I still have my hdx, but mainly use it for music, as the sound is still better on my 3rd gen hdx than my newest galaxy tab s2, even through headphones"
"December 19, 2015","When I download mixtapes and other s*** I can't buy in your music library simply because these are songs that aren't available in any music store mostly your app doesn't show them in the recently downloaded playlist anymore wth amazon???"
"March 16, 2015","Great selection, great quality, lacks ""radio station"" like ability. So I can select a bunch of stuff to ""add to my selection"" but I can't (or can't find it) select a simple set of music (ie Genre) to play or stream like a radio. However, I do love it...it's become my go to music source"
"October 4, 2013","since i am not that tech savvy this entire process had me fearful, but it was easy to download, use and buy songs with. don't hesitate."
"September 28, 2016","Trustworthy and reliable friend"
"September 11, 2016","Anyone having trouble getting this to install on 6.0 make sure to let Audible and Kindle fully update and then it will download and install. Now I get to enjoy Prime Music!"
"April 20, 2016","I love Amazon Music. I have used the other music apps out there and I find the best quality and variety with this one. Im so happy I made the change! I would highly recommend this service if you love music!!"
"June 17, 2014","I am not a misic junkie. I Dont have spotify or itunes and stuff...I use Google's all access...its better for me. This service would be great if it offered the same volume of songs as Google. I use Google to pick up current songs to play as I write fiction. My most inspirational songs are all free on Google. Out of 86 Amazon had 10 free. Not worth it honestly."
"June 18, 2014","The old version worked great, and I could move between songs without having to open the album song list. On this one, there are buttons all over the place on my phone that SAY I can move forward or backward between songs [lock screen, a swipe on my lock screen, the notice screen, and even the ""now playing"" screen inside the app], but they don't work, either on the phone itself or while using it through Bluetooth. The only way I can change songs is to open the song list, but if I want to listen to my current song again, I have to change songs first. This is beyond annoying! And having to open a song list while operating a car is not only dangerous, but ILLEGAL in my state. I also cannot turn off the music by using the pause button on the lock screen of my phone as I previously was able to do. This is a basic loss of functionality that surely should have been tested for before releasing it to the public. It makes me regret downloading the update."
"April 25, 2015","I really like Amazon Music w/ Prime, if for no other reason than I can take my phone in the car and play music I like, instead of relying on my old factory installed radio, lol. There are also lots of songs to add to your collection for free, and premade playlists geared to your interests :) ."
"June 7, 2013","Conflicts with my other systems , but I fiure out how to work it,you need if you down load songs from amazon so what can i say.They got you by the Balls"
"January 10, 2013","Terrific concept: just what a cloud player should be! Generous amount of uploads of my own music and unlimited storage of purchased music so a little incentive there to look around and see what Amazon has to offer. Playlists and up to 10 devices so all members of the family can have their music- even iOs devices along with droid. One Wish: categories by genre: classical, pop, country etc are all mixed together so there's a bit of wading thru just to remember what's on there."
"November 24, 2015","It is really annoying that two adults in the same household cannot share amazon music. But otherwise this app is fantastic!"
"January 18, 2013","Once I downloaded the Amazon MP3 player on to my adroid phone it was very difficult to get any information on how to download songs from my computer to the MP3 player. I had to call Amazon's customer service number 4 times before anyone told me that first you had to download the amazon app along with the steps for the android phone as well as the amazon download installer before anything would work. Once it was working it was fine but way too much hassle to begin with."
"September 11, 2017","I have only had it for 3 days and so far I am very impressed. Many genres to pick from... Like the song it will play more like it .. pretty cool 👍"
"February 4, 2016","Just started using this app. My wife and I are pleased sofar. We had Beats Music as part of our ATT plan then it was axed and we refuse to use anything associated with Apple since its now Apple Music. Thanks for a great app."
"May 30, 2017","I can't hardly get it to work. When it does it's just for a song or two. Very dissatisfied"
"August 17, 2016","Ugh. This music app lacks sooooo much music"
"March 2, 2016","My family and I are enjoying the app."
"April 20, 2016","Not enough music yet that I'm looking for. Amazon should explore adding a feature like datpiff.com that offers a variety of free music from artist that aren't necessarily a part of the artist major release."
"July 10, 2014","Love it, additional bonus with Amazon Prime. Millions of songs, really enjoying it."
"November 2, 2016","Constantly says my SD card is full and refuses to download purchased music. Removing the SD and remarrying doesn't work now. Customer service won't respond."
"June 20, 2016","What's not to like? And if you have an Amazon Echo, awesome!"
"April 29, 2017","I love it best thing ever."
"May 18, 2015","Just a few percentage of music content is available for prime subscribers. I was attracted by the price but very disappointed when find out that just a few track are included in the prime account. In addition the player is too poor in options compared to spotyfy or beats music players."
"April 13, 2014","Very conveiant music site extensive title list, that allows for large cloud and device storage. One segestion, the music sample/ preview could use some updating. Prices are comperable to ITunes and have the option to bill to your Amazon credit card or other major card. In Addison the cloud works flawlesslly with multiple devices. Refreshing in today's conjested tech world"
"December 20, 2016","It's a little hard to navigate. I think it could be more user friendly. However, the app works great and haven't had any issues with it otherwise."
"October 25, 2015","Not too bad but lacks a large variety in the classic country genre. When listening to their radio during a work day it seems like I listen to the same songs 2 and 3 times in an 8 hour period. I switched back to Pandora for my music streaming needs."
"November 9, 2016","We are obsessed! It's so much better than Pandora!"
"November 13, 2015","If your spouse pays for Amazon Prime, you cannot use the streaming Music service even if he or she does not use it. Amazon should allow both partners to use the Music service or at lease allow the customers to decide who will use the service."
"October 7, 2017","Super easy to use. I love it!"
"February 14, 2016","It feels so good to be listening to music again! I haven't had music in my house to much these past few years...it's so wonderful...I have more energy from dancing around to the music and doing my chores. Life is great!"
"June 4, 2016","I like being able to skip unlimited times and listen without ads"
"June 27, 2016","App constantly crashes, and won update give an error 505."
"February 17, 2016","This app works on all devices EXCEPT my Fire phone running CyanogenMod 11, and it appears that Amazon has intentionally written the Prime Music app to crash on launch if it is running on a Fire device with a custom ROM."
"July 31, 2016","Great app! More useful than Google Music"
"June 6, 2016","I can't benefit from my prime membership abroad. Disappointing."
"October 3, 2017","I love this App. It is so much more convenient than regular radio or cds. I would recommend to anyone."
"February 10, 2017","I've only been using for a few days but so far it is the best music app I've used. Great selection easy to use and I love you can see the lyrics."
"May 18, 2015","would be better if there were parental controls or some type of filters for explicit music"
"July 7, 2015","Very happy about this app available for prime. Have it 4 starts because a few hiccups in playing music. If I select from my recent playlist or station, it will only play one song. So I have to go back and select the play list all over again to have it stream multiple songs."
"June 14, 2014","I have a fair amount of music from Amazon, and an Amazon Prime account, so was quite excited to hear about their new streaming service. Mostly I listen to music with a Samsung Galaxy Player 3.6, which has always worked great. When I tried to update my Amazon mp3 player, it just vanished, and will not recognize this new app. Now I have lost the ability to play any of my Amazon music on my primary player. No lwhere did I see something saying the new app didn't work with gingerbread. Heads up Amazon, there are still a lot of gingerbread devices out there, especially smaller specialty devices."
"February 18, 2016","Great variety, I wish they had more of a selection for stations though, a more detailed option of music. I like being able to see the lyrics and download the songs and playlist. Unlimited slips and ad free is the best."
"May 6, 2017","I like how the lyrics are posted for some of the songs. It really is a great add on considering Amazon music is only one to do it."
"February 6, 2016","I never used it. It was too much to bother with. Not easy to find individual songs. Went to google play store typed in song and it downloaded and played in existing an app. I didn't need another app I just needed 2 songs."
"December 18, 2016","Bonus"
"June 4, 2017","Outstanding!!"
"October 20, 2016","I thought it was free"
"June 7, 2016","love it!!! use it all the time, at work, home, car and so on."
"May 23, 2017","great music. easy to use"
"May 15, 2016","This app alone is worth paying for a Prime membership if you're a music lover! Use this all the time! Amazing selection. I quit using the other music app that shall not be named after getting this."
"November 2, 2014","This app is SLOW. Hit the screen and wait for a response for two seconds... Then watch the app crash because you told it to do more than one thing at a time. I download it to get my mp3s then I uninstall it. This is the case on my Droid Maxx, My Nexus 7 and my Nexus 10. Also my Mac and PC apps are crap too just like this one."
"June 16, 2016","Easy of access, Music arable, work hasn'the blocked access."
"June 18, 2014","I don't like the change at all. With the old version my music loaded fast and continued playing when I did other things on my phone. Now the music loads slowly and stops when I'm doing other things. This version also requires more storage space and I had to uninstall another app for this update to download. I also lost 3 playlists and I'm having to redo them."
"April 3, 2017","Great product that I can listen to at anytime on my iPhone 7 plus. A must have for me."
"November 12, 2016","Made it to hard to upload music to my account.... I better system like the old one would be better I might not renew my subscription if it doesn't change"
"August 12, 2012","A must have! AmazonMP3 has every conceivable piece of music available. The cloud at it's best and easiest. On your Android device,tablet, PC and now even steam it through Roku II onto your HDTV and more to come I'm sure. Burn your tunes, store them, play them and ACCESS them from anywhere, literally. Amazon does it all and here's even more proof."
"September 21, 2016","Great app. I have never had any issues with the app. Any purchases I make go smoothly. 99% of the time I just listen to the free music stations using my prime music."
"July 12, 2015","Gone. Never had a clue how it works. Don't have wifi. Don't understand streaming. This got me flummexed. I can't tell you if it's good or not. My experience was awful but I don't think it had anything to do with this. Sorry I can't be helpful. It's gone as fast as others"
"June 13, 2016","Quality sound, variety for the price of prime, its amazing."
"November 1, 2016","pretty good app!"
"January 12, 2017","I have found the Amazon Music App to be quite useful when I am in a hurry and don't have time to visit the Amazon Music Website on my computer."
"July 10, 2015","I like it .. it needs a better user interface .. but its free so i dont expect much  someone invent a nice visualizer for this or allow tools such as WinAmp (a music/media player) to hook and control the library ... nobody needs a 2nd rate proprietary player"
"February 17, 2012","While the updates have been slow and I do feel the app is WAY to heavy, it is somewhat better. I still spend time clicking the same song 10 times while shopping trying to review it only to have the song 5 tracks down start playing. As a loyal customer to Amazon I do want them to have great apps to support the music I buy from them. However this app in the past few months has cut my music shopping/exploring time in half. Simply put, this app is not up to Amazon standards IMO."
"June 2, 2016","It would be great if Amazon Music worked together Google cast."
"July 1, 2015","Nothing special at all."
"February 28, 2015","All Stone Barrington's books are excellent"
"June 21, 2016","No interruptions. Find category music without a problem."
"October 27, 2015","I can't live without it.."
"July 8, 2016","Oh the things I have played you while doing (working, driving from state to state, city to city, ect) The music available to prime users, the playlist that can be created. Thank you!"
"February 16, 2016","The library has some great music, but is missing a lot of oldies, but goodies, especially from the 90s and early 2000s. Also, new songs that come out are no longer new if or when they become available in the library."
"June 7, 2016","Love, love, love. So easy to use and great choices of music."
"December 3, 2015","If you download songs on your device with Prime music, it stores them in locked format so you can only play them through the app. They won't play through your usual music app or on your pc. My guess is that it won't be the case if you buy the song. Either way, it's not a versatile music app, sucks your battery, and it's not even nice-looking.  Only good part is that it sincronizes well with the amazon app and you can import the mp3 already on your device"
"May 24, 2017","Love it. Eats up alotta my data allowance tho!"
"January 25, 2017","Surprised I am liking this so much, for I am a Spotify girl. I find it latches on to my taste better than some other music apps I have tried."
"August 9, 2016","Excellent library of music. So easy to use! Love! We checked other services for a few oldies and they didn't have. So far, Amazon has nearly every song we're looking for!"
"February 23, 2016","Amazon music is ok. I can't say it's amazing. I would give it 3 stars, but the only reason why I'm giving 4 is because it's free, so that merits an extra star. I wish the selection was bigger, but it is what it is."
"June 20, 2014","My fav thing, if you download any songs it imports them to your iTunes library, what a great feature! The play lists are pretty good so far and the amount of free prime music is actually surprising but, I'd really like to not pay for pandora one any more so if there were streaming radio like pandora I'd be all over it! I'm sure they're working on that tho."
"July 27, 2016","Great selection of music and streaming is on-par with Pandora, Spotify and Slacker premium services and what I pay basically gives me free Prime Video and shipping as a benefit."
"June 9, 2016","Love it listen to my music going home from long day at work"
"February 13, 2017","I use this app on my various electronic devices. It is on my pc as a desktop version. My smart phone, and my tablet too. It works really well."
"May 1, 2016","This has now become my staple music player. I is extremely easy to use, intuitive, and fast. I love the face that it will play my stored music on the device as well as from the Amazon cloud library."
"September 10, 2017","New to prime My kids and I love Music. Beats us all paying for different music apps."
"October 18, 2016","Won't stay in place"
"June 18, 2016","what can I say its great just music however you want it."
"September 25, 2014","I want my old Amazon Music app back!! To simply listen to the music already on my phone, it's entirely too complicated, and whatever the app is running in the background, it's sucking power from my battery at an alarming rate. That only started happening after I ""upgraded"" this app. I may have to uninstall it altogether."
"June 23, 2015","Crashing constantly and requests to send a report on a daily basis, sometimes several times.Have not even used it properly yet.I don't like posting a review like this for anything on amazon because they have always been efficent and very customer oriented in my experience."
"July 29, 2017","Love the playlists and being able to shuffle between them."
"June 23, 2015","Great selection, quality, and cool library. Forget about using your wireless data, at least if u have limits, because it consumes a lot of data and running memory."
"August 26, 2017","It's the cooling daddy-o."
"August 16, 2015","Very limited selection of music that fits my taste. Not easy to ""like"" a new song while driving: seems to require three steps vs. Goggle Play Music's one. I was hoping I could replace Google with Amazon and save some $, but that's not going to happen."
"February 28, 2016","This is a great way to get music I enjoy."
"July 24, 2015","I love every playlist. There is so much variety and it is easy to navigate I love the 50 most popular song playlists of different time periods and genres."
"August 10, 2017","Love it...easy too use..just as good if not better than most music apps"
"August 9, 2015","Its Great! Just needs more songs. Thank you."
"April 23, 2016","I Can Not Download My Music Even If Paid For. Can Not Play While Working On PC can Not Find App on PC Desktop  Shame On You Amazon for bending us over after promising such a great app."
"December 31, 2015","Whoever is curating this site is doing a great job!!!!!  However, I wish it was easier to find in Amazon Prime. I always have to do a search for Prime Music streaming to find it. It should be right on the homepage."
"December 10, 2016","I love Amazon Music, it is awesome! They have great stations playing the latest hits and you can listen to anything that's out there right now!"
"May 30, 2017","So far I like it. I've only come across a couple of songs that it Alexa cannot find."
"May 29, 2015","Not able to store music on ExtSD sucks"
"October 8, 2016","Wow, this feature rocks! Any song you want streamed to any device plus hosts all the music you buy. Switched all my listening and streaming to this service."
"June 18, 2016","it would be better if you could download the smartphone"
"October 20, 2016","Hard to navigate."
"September 16, 2016","Lots of oldies and classic rock, but it's missing a lot of more recent hits and artists. Needs more Willie Nelson albums! Also, it can be pretty blotchy sometimes."
"March 15, 2016","Dislike the fact I can't use when I'm connected to another accounot and do not pay for prime. Me and my father split it thinking we received the same benifits but nope. Disappointed have no use for this app."
"March 14, 2017","best Music app ever!"
"December 29, 2014","This review refers to the Amazon Prime music library:  A lot of re-records (even on songs that don't specifiy it), live versions, obscure songs by artists, and waaaaaaaaaaaaay too much Christmas music instead of regular music. Streams well and sound quality is good, but selection is somewhat disappointing."
"February 17, 2015","Ok Prime members and music lovers, you need this app. I'm late to the digital game, so when I bought my Lady Gaga CD I was surprised that Prime gave me the digital versions too. Then I added the Amazon music app to my Samung and BAMB, Gaga all the time! Easy to use, loads fast and great quality."
"May 5, 2016","Playlist Generation unworkable full of glitches and bugs. No radio service comparable to spotify. No music suggestions for my Playlist or absent navigation for different music exposure."
"November 19, 2015","Its a real playlist site. Not just a station sight. I prefer to the alternatives. Though it doesn't have some of the songs I was looking for. But still an amazing site and has an amazing library slection that is easy to use and access."
"June 15, 2016","Easy to set up. I haven't fully implemented it mas yet"
"August 7, 2016","Not working well with Samsung Galaxy S5"
"April 3, 2015","How could you not love music on prime :)"
"June 23, 2015","It always freezes, crashes, and it never plays more than 1 song before it wont load more.  I only gave it a 2nd star because i like the idea of the app"
"May 3, 2017","I enjoy the variety of music !"
"June 22, 2014","too soon to tell. Not explored enough. Tried it on mobile and didnt work too well. email again in 3 months. Not sure if this is the way to go or itunes. Only works when connected to the cloud. I run with my ipod nano and shuffle, tiny devices. Will not work there unless Amazon comes up with a way to interface to the ipod or comes out with its own nano."
"August 29, 2017","I have yet to be able to log on to the app."
"August 8, 2016","Really awesome unless you have a cheap Android like I used to have after upgrading my phone and using T-Mobile Service it works like a champ guess you get what you pay for"
"September 8, 2015","I really want to access my AM on the road, but this is very difficult. I certainly wish I could migrate my music to an offline music tool."
"October 3, 2014","This is Anais singing some of her loveliest, saddest songs, with only her guitar accompanying her distinctive voice. Most of the songs of ones we've heard before, on earlier albums, but done this way, each song is new, alive, and almost unbearably painful and beautiful. Anais is a musical treasure; we're so lucky to have her!"
"June 24, 2014","There is so much music to choose from that is free because of being a Prime Member. I really like the already made play lists."
"October 5, 2015","Nice compilation is possible here. Only downside, you better maintain your prime status otherwise makes I tunes not the only game in town anymore. This isn't perfect, but it never annoys me like other players do. It just works, and plays music."
"July 14, 2015","Fun and personal experience."
"November 27, 2015","I waited a long time before taking the plunge and getting prime. What a mistake. I have definitely gotten my money's worth with the prime shipping and prime video. Add the prime music and I don't know why anyone would not get prime."
"August 12, 2015","With all the HORRIBLE reviews I'm glad I didn't peruse this option! It was one reason why I got Amazon Prime. Sounds like they have blinders on and don't have the right people in place to take care what sounds like a very simple fix. No bandaids please!!!"
"November 2, 2015","Great service, needs getting used to. I would be nice to have a recommendation of a possible playlist from artist searches. Or even ask questions to what type of music, genre, or artist and then put together a playlist from the results."
"July 21, 2015","I Don't use it"
"June 26, 2017","Alot of Music, I thought you could download...you cant."
"November 11, 2017","I like this app, if apple does not have it amazon does!"
"April 20, 2016","I have an after market Car Audio in my car and it does not sync well via Bluetooth, or USB Connection. I have the Boss Audio BV9976B. All of my apple products work but not my samsung galaxy s7"
"January 28, 2014","I may be wrong, but it seems one needs their propitiatory downloader and I've had occasional problems with getting it out of the cloud and into my computer. I am not chained to a smart phone, but use a desktop and a laptop computer .. and my Kindle. Nice to be able to access it, but I've been lost rather often when searching for where on my device Amazon decided to download the song."
"July 26, 2014","Great app. Amazon lets you download a lot of free music if you are a Prime member. I have been a prime member for years and it is one of the best investments I make. Even with the price going up, it is still a bargain. Plus you get a lot of free movies. Thanks Amazon. I only wish you could make more money as my stock would be a little higher."
"August 9, 2016","Huge selection especially of music from the 60's - 80's. Prices are good if you need to buy them but with Prime you can build a great playlist for your kindle or I phone."
"January 5, 2015","Takes up too much battery for android. I don't know why but it always says Amazon Music is taking up the most battery. Samsung Galaxy S4. I don't even have it running and not even signed in and it says it takes up the most battery. Always forced to 'Force Stop'. I uninstalled simply because of this reason."
"June 16, 2016","Nothing special that I heart does not offer for free."
"February 28, 2015","This is Thee best way to find great music, at great prices.....sometimes even free. Another feature I love is I spend lots of time in very agressive outdoor Activities. Phones don't always survive my adventures. Not to worry if I trash a phone, as my 500+ songs are protected in my Prime Account."
"August 24, 2015","ok"
"December 20, 2014","It's a fairly good music app but you can't download any of the Prime music unless you buy it. The free offerings are not bad but not that great so what's the point? Pandora or an Ipod are probably a little better."
"July 18, 2015","Very user friendly!"
"November 25, 2015","Love the app on my Android and PC. Listening to Prime music on my Android is awesome. Although I will say I don't much care for the altering of my music folders on it. It could be my settings so I still will give it the five stars."
"October 14, 2016","It doesn't quite compare to Pandora, which I'm used to. When I searched Nora En Pure, all I got was her music, not a mixed playlist with similar artists."
"May 13, 2015","Love the idea of being able to play the same song again but I am suspect of the idea that if I do it too many times (song was on repeat as backdrop to my working) the song suddenly becomes unavailable in Prime Music, which means the only way to hear the song again is to buy it."
"April 10, 2016","I like the performance of the app on my Android phone and the music selection. Big plus (vs youtube, etc. at least for me as a Republic Wireless user), is that it seems to use WiFi and no cell data."
"May 1, 2017","Great music easy downloads no commercials"
"September 26, 2017","What not to like."
"June 19, 2014","I really like Amazon Music. But using PlayerPro as a model, it could use the following: --really cool programmable equalizer --better sort function --album art editing ability --gapless playback and crossover fade capability  PlayerPro for Android:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KWY2O9O/ref=cm_cd_asin_lnk"
"July 16, 2016","Imposible to listen off line unless you buy"
"June 15, 2014","I enjoying using it. It is so very easy to use. I like being able to add extra Prime music."
"June 16, 2016","Great products and quick delivery movies not so good"
"September 6, 2016","Excellent music choices very happy with Amazon"
"July 10, 2014","Customized playlists are WAY better than any other music app I've had!"
"April 29, 2016","I am really enjoying the choices and the music. I have been able to find music that I enjoy time and again. My only issue, I can't always find what I had before. But that could be the user. :)"
"October 12, 2015","I love this. I recently discovered it and have found that this is now my go to place for downloads. I love that you can search for songs or find pre-made playlists. It's great. There is a huge selection of music here. Something for everyone."
"September 29, 2016","Met all expectations"
"October 12, 2016","Love Amazon music. Great selection of tunes even the odd ball Stuff that isn't as common. I like that on a lot of music the lyrics are also available."
"June 26, 2015","Nice Prime music selection and nice pre-made playlist but the app is terribly slow. I like the lyrics part and the radio with unlimited skips as well as the radio stations. I like the option to be able to download playlist to use offline. But the player doesn't work when I turn off all my radios. How do I know it's really offline music then? After listening to music for a random period of time the music will just stop playing. I'll pause it and play it again for it to work for only another few minutes till I have to completely close and re-open the app. Not really sure what this BlackBerry/Amazon deal was but it sure was more in Amazon's favor then BlackBerry users. Amazon took over BlackBerry music and video services but brought slow faulty ported apps to in place of it all."
"February 5, 2015","The Best music purchasing service since Napster circa 1999; works on everything I own. I buy and a copy of the purchase downloads to my home PC! They music plays every where but it's nice to have a copy just in case. Love Prime Music. I just wish Prime Instant Video would learn from this app."
"June 20, 2014","With all the good music services out there - this is a weak contender. You can't download and save and it takes up WAY too much memory on a phone for just being a player. It gets one star rather than zero since Prime members get it free. The download process from the Amazon store for Android has too many steps. It's easier from the Google store."
"July 8, 2017","Playlists are a little weak."
"January 30, 2017","prime music errors out and won't restart, it seems difficult to get the music I want and then have it play correctly using PC or mobile."
"February 18, 2017","I have this integrated into Alexa and it is great. The music selection is great but Pandora kicks in when certain songs are not listed."
"February 9, 2017","Only four stars because Amazon should come with a self help section for people who are addicted to next day door step one click service."
"December 19, 2016","Amazon prime is the best service for it's price. 100 bucks for free 2 day shipping, Amazon videoand music. My most used apps. Thank you."
"October 9, 2016","I love Prime Music, streaming is tricky with artist not wanting to be on certain services but most of the artist I want to hear is on here so it's great."
"September 24, 2014","With this app the sync on my car no longer functions. Can only change songs by unlocking my phone and going to the app. I no longer have to quick access from my locked screen. It has made using my app player non functional during my long commute. It also wiped out all of my saved playlists when I updated. Not happy at all."
"October 5, 2016","crap song choices"
"June 15, 2016","Fun to listen to the songs they have on Prime Music"
"June 11, 2016","Perfect to making customized play lists for running!"
"October 11, 2016","Won't let me update the app error 505. Then after all the suggested ways to fix it i did a factory reset and lost it. Now I can't install it. Error 505."
"February 2, 2016","Not sure if it's just me but this app will not play albums without a pause between tracks. Especially annoying when listening to live albums and albums where the tracks blend together. 5 stars if that gets fixed."
"December 23, 2014","Not bad at all. I like it. The only bad thing is it only lets you stream from one device at a time. I cannot stream music on my phone while wife is on hers. It asks me to kick her off. Very bad design."
"June 14, 2016","love the playlist always updated music to listen to"
"August 30, 2017","Great variety of music and so easy to add to my library! Love it!"
"July 5, 2014","The application fails randomly and frequently. I have friends who have no problems with this app, but then I have a multitude of difficulties and am left to wonder why. The service would be great if the player functioned properly. But until the day the application functions correctly I cannot rate the Prime Music player any higher than 2 stars."
"February 21, 2017","Keeps playing songs that I don't like after I dislike them.. and I would like to see more to pick from. I been looking for some AC/DC"
"May 29, 2017","Great selection"
"May 10, 2017","Way better than i thought it would be! And that's coming from someone who listens to Pandora all the time!"
"April 28, 2017","Really great for most music. Definitely a step above Spotify but some songs require the unlimited version."
"July 26, 2015","Love this app. It is like Pandora but better because it doesn't have commercials and lets you go back and forward as many times as you would like."
"December 4, 2015","Amazon prime Music has provided me with ready access to a vast array of albums but I particularly like the offered playlists. Being able to select a mood or theme and then sit back and listen is useful for dinner parties etc."
"September 19, 2014","Per a chat with Amazon Technical Support, I had to load the Amazon Store app so that I could use that app to load this one. Then, it still wouldn't work. They had me uninstall & reinstall, but same errors. THEN, the support agent told me that it was a known issue with my LG L9 phone... after spending 30mins troubleshooting."
"October 27, 2015","Love the vast selection!"
"October 30, 2016","good app"
"June 7, 2016","Only real complaint is the limited library selection"
"September 2, 2016","Works pretty well, the navigation can be a bit vexing on mobile, but the music library is solid, and building mobile playlists trumps spotify's free mobile app."
"September 3, 2017","Definitely a fan of this music roadway"
"May 3, 2016","Disappointed that I have to pay additional money to store my music library on the cloud. I can do the same with Google music and it's free. Amazon music is not worth paying anything extra."
"March 31, 2013","First, I had to download the Amazon Appstore. Then I had to download the Amazon MP3 Player. After I downloaded it to my smartphone, I couldn't find it. I had to open Appstore, open the menu, select ""downloaded apps, then open the app on my phone. It took me a while to figure it put and the procedures are well hidden. Once I opened it on my smartphone, I could listen to my ""99 Piano Masterpieces"" fo 99 cents on my smartphone."
"March 30, 2013","The app works well for streaming music that I have purchased from Amazon. I really like how Amazon retroactively has provided MP3s for CDs I have purchased in years past. I wish the app would keep up with Android's features like Jelly Bean's expanding notifications, but overall it is my goto streaming music player. I like it better than Google Music for Android. Now if only Amazon would release the Amazon Video stuff for non-Kindle Android."
"September 29, 2016","item as described"
"July 7, 2015","My wife and I started having problems this past Sunday with Amazon Music Store, which she has been using for a month. On Monday, I replaced her old Moto X with a new Moto X, same gen, installed Music Store again, and started downloading all her music. Downloads were slow and practically overwhelmed my wifi with upstream requests. On Tuesday, all the downloaded (Offline) music files on her phone, about 700, were corrupted. On Wednesday, all the downloaded music files on my phone, about 300, were corrupted. On Thursday, tech support helped me figure out how to download the files again, because up to that point, Music store wouldn't let me download music files again. On Friday, my wife and I were driving 14 hours to Seattle. We verified that, even though we were playing only offline content, the app was still burning through my Verizon data plan. Her phone went through my entire monthly allotment in less than half a day. So I turned off data plan data. Amazon acknowledged the problem, said it's working on a fix, but has not yet offered any fixes. On Saturday, all the free content on both our phones was corrupted again, along with some of the paid content. For literally days worth of trouble, Amazon offered a $5 coupon. It's now Tuesday, eight days later, and this review won't change unless I hear from Amazon. If you're traveling somewhere and want to take your music with you, DON'T depend on this app. It's now Thursday, 10 days later, and the latest attempt to download music resulted in nothing but corrupted files. Interestingly enough, all the files I paid for are good this time, but all the prime free content is corrupted. So far so good. A new update installed, as of July 10, and we've gone two days without losing prime music. And just in case I didn't make this clear, the last two times the downloads were corrupted, only Prime music was affected, not the purchased music. I take it back. All the ""free"" music that I downloaded from Amazon for my wife is corrupted again. Am I paranoid to suspect that Amazon doesn't want its Prime members downloading and listening to free music. Why is it that only the Prime music downloads get corrupted, while the albums I bought remain playable. What is the point of offering free music if you then take it away after two or three days?"
"March 28, 2015","Seems to work well. I have used it often.."
"July 31, 2014","Love this free service and the app is pretty good. I'd suggest that it remembers what my last refinement was (if I was sorting by Artist last time, don't friggin bring me back to Albums every time). Other than that small annoyance it's good.  I have Prime so I've got a pretty decent selection of music I've added to my library."
"June 24, 2016","A must have for Prime members that love music!"
"December 20, 2016","Nice interface and good selection but not available on enough products. I would like to be able to use it on my smart TV or XBox One."
"February 19, 2017","I prefer high resolution music streaming service than just mp3 streaming services.  How about emblacing 'TIDAL' in amazon ?"
"March 15, 2015","Predictions here for music that I like were not very on the mark, as far as the playlists went.quality could have been better , definitely has some competition out there . But I would say good addition to Prime membership for no additional money ,even the Prime membership went up AGAIN!"
"March 13, 2017","So far so good. I wish I could every song that i like. However the variety is good enough."
"May 3, 2017","Downloaded the app to listen to music under my Amazon Prime account and it will not play anything. Search an artist and try to play a song and all it does is prompt me to pay $9.99 a month. Click on one of the offered stations. And I get promptes to pay $9.99 a month. The phone is an S7. So I deleted it and went back to the competition. Also considering if this Amazon Prime is even worth it when it does not live up to all it claims to be. I would give a zero star rating if possible"
"September 30, 2016","Very convenient!"
"November 1, 2016","Enjoy!"
"March 31, 2011","The Amazon MP3 app came as 'bloat-ware' on my Moto Defy so I've been ignoring it for months. Now that Amazon has their Cloud service in full swing, this app suddenly has a lot of potential. So far music streaming works great on WiFi and 3G. I would like to see an onboard equalizer though. Aside from that it works as advertised and I look forward to seeing how far they can take their new Cloud ecosystem."
"December 9, 2014","Amazon Prime Music is a great app! It is free, and they offer a ton of free playlists and albums with great music available. I have downloaded a large volume of Christmas music and it did not cost anything, absolutely free! Amazon continues to improve their site and apps and I would recommend this product!"
"October 22, 2016","Not good."
"March 31, 2016","The service did not work with my Samsung six phone. I feel this is an issue with my phone. The battery had to be charged after the download. I attempt the process twice and had the same issue."
"February 6, 2015","It does provide access to the massive online selections, but it really does drain your device. Always running and killing your performance/battery. Force stopping it is a temporary measure at best since it always pops back up. Linked to the amazon store app, and altogether, they are a mess."
"November 4, 2016","Amazon music is the absolute best! There are so many options! I love my playlists and the fact that i can download to my phone for offline use."
"June 23, 2014","After having to listen to more and more advertising on Pandora, I finally gave Amazon a try and it was great. I had to install a couple of different apps before I could download it, but once I did, we didn't turn it off all night. And two of my friends downloaded it at the same time and both of them are now permanent listeners too. Good app."
"December 27, 2012","This app is probably fine when performance is compared to Fire OS apps, it is probably fine when you are connected to the internet at all times, and it is likely fantastic when the lockscreen controls glitch out and flash repeatedly. Yet, when it lags, force quits because you are out of mobile range, and refuses to work with 4.2 lockscreens, I am forced to find a new player. For downloading music, however, there is no competitor in either selection or ease."
"July 16, 2016","Way better than I thought. After years of using Pandora, uuugh, the ads. Love the Prime stations for genres. Skip all you like, repeat, great selection for any setting."
"June 25, 2014","After starting the player i listened to a few songs then opted to skip another. The player then was playing two songs simultaneously. I could not get it to stop. Every time I pressed play, i was listening to hall & oates at the same time it was playing simply red. I also couldn't find an exit or quit option. Never had that issue with Pandora."
"May 10, 2016","So far so good, you can listen to music that isnt normally played on internet radio which is awesome, and you can always buy a song if you like it i just like it for its better variety."
"September 29, 2016","always pleaseed"
"July 13, 2015","Wonderful service!"
"June 10, 2016","Excellent choices of music. Setup slightly troublesome."
"February 21, 2015","I am a fan of Amazon, whenever I am looking for ""anything "" I immediately log onto Amazon and 90% of the time what I need is on the site and available at a reasonable cost. Also, the shipping is very quick!!! Hats off and a bow to Amazon, so glad to have found this incredible site!"
"June 27, 2015","App is slow, not as user-friendly as other apps, and sometimes has as mind of its own. Music Store searches are sluggish and time-consuming. I use it because I have Amazon Prime. Guess the technology of the application has not quite caught up with the times."
"August 27, 2015","Won't play music at a steady rate. Better when downloaded instead of streaming but either way only plays mono vs. stereo and pauses frequently"
"September 29, 2015","I'm new to Prime Music but not to Amazon Prime which I use to order EVERYTHING! I was pleased to see how many Tommy Emmanuel tracks were available for free streaming. I will undoubtedly be ordering more TE music soon. Very pleased so far."
"June 15, 2014","This latest update is AWFUL!!! Why should it take over 2 minutes to start playing an mp3 using the app when the mp3 is on my phone. Come on Amazon! Any one know how I can go back to the previous version? You know... the one that worked??? This is a mess."
"April 8, 2015","I like Amazon music is awesome and I listen to it almost every day. Amazon prime makes it so easy and free (under $10 a month and practically everything is,please pay attention if your on a fixed income or have 6 kids like I do. This is a way to get Huge hugs for a little $)"
"May 8, 2017","Everything I can think of is right here in Amazon prime music. I love my Amazon prime music. Let's go."
"July 25, 2016","I love that this is included with my prime membership, the problem with this app is very obvious, the available selection. I'm glad there aren't commercials included."
"October 12, 2016","I listen to it all day when I am home. And just learned that through the Bluetooth connection in my car I can also play Prime as I travel. Love it!"
"June 15, 2016","Easy to use and convenient to have on my phone"
"January 27, 2017","It seems to work fairly well, but I have some music I down loaded and I've noticed it skips."
"March 13, 2016","So so, I preffer google play for listening to my songs not in the cloud and almost all of my music is not in the cloud and I don't want it there. So Amazon is great and cloud music and bad at mp3s."
"January 13, 2014","This is a must have if you want to download music on your Android device. To my surprise, after I got the Amazon MP3 app, I was able to easily get my Amazon Cloud on my device and therefore listen to all of the music that I had already downloaded for another device. It's easy to use and if you like music, Amazon is one of the best sources to find just about any MP3 you want."
"June 11, 2016","Probably the best music service I've ever used!"
"April 13, 2015","I am always thrilled with ALL of my purchases through Amazon and Amazon Prime. Music, books, and movies, and other products. I have never had whatsoever any problems, or delays etc. with the services rendered. Thank You Job Well Done Amazon. It takes a great STAFF I am sure."
"July 14, 2014","This issue with the app only playing music from a specific destination folder on the internal card is also creating another problem, playing music you didn't purchase from Amazon. If a sizable portion of your (large) music library isn't from Amazon, this app is worse than useless, it actually makes your music listening experience worse."
"September 5, 2017","Absolutely fabulous. Hits from today and from years gone by."
"February 4, 2016","What does a ""genre"" channel play the same songs at start of every play session? It's as if I have an old school mix tape and it's the same every time?  Haven't tried via PC, but have higher hopes."
"October 12, 2017","I really enjoy this app with my Prime Membership!"
"March 17, 2017","Great! So far I've had nothing but good experience with this product and the firestick."
"April 20, 2015","I like that I can listen to a whole album without commercials, but listening to a particular genre isn't so easy. It would help to have a seed song that guides the following songs. Also, not all artists are available, so it makes getting started a little more troublesome."
"August 5, 2015","Love this prime service. We use it all the time. Especially nice now that we have the Amazon Firestick and can play music through the TV."
"September 16, 2014","I downloaded the app to my android tablet as well as android phone, but the music downloaded to my Kindle Fire does not sync with the other two. It is such a disappointment as I like to listen to music on my cell phone while I take a walk. If there is any way to sync the music with my android products, please let me know."
"June 19, 2017","Love Amazon music! So easy to use!"
"May 2, 2016","Not so into it, as it is not very easy to set your stations and have my ALEXA play it. It is rather confusing if compared to other music services. I am not happy with Amazon Prime."
"June 9, 2016","I love having all this music at my fingertips!!"
"July 19, 2017","do not like. don't like how the channels are set up. i will suggest that other stick with Pandora like I will be."
"February 22, 2016","I love that I don't have to think too hard with the Prime Music playlists! There are all types of playlists and moods to suit the listener. I've been recommending this to everyone with a Prime account!"
"May 19, 2013","We've moved all of our music now to Amazon MP3, after trying it out for a couple of months. It works very well, and it's really nice to have our music available to different devices via the internet...and not to have the music taking up a lot of room on our computer. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't always recognize songs from obscure bands and sometimes gives us trouble uploading songs if it doesn't recognize it."
"May 18, 2015","I was really excited about Amazon developing this service. Then I tried it. It is overly complicated to use, has a clumsy, non-intuitive interface, crashes on my Samsung S5 phone regularly, and has issues streaming consistently. More trouble than it is worth, overall."
"September 28, 2016","Awesome music"
"August 16, 2016","Limited selection and oldies. Can't really compare to other music apps in terms of the latest hits. Maybe they will eventually catch up with more recent music?"
"April 15, 2017","It's okay but, too dark and the text to small."
"July 20, 2015","I think it's a rip off that Amazon make you buy multiple Prime family memberships to get their music. I don't recall it being this way in the past. Now we have 2 Prime Memberships in our house just so we can each access Prime Music via our smart phones."
"August 28, 2016","Great app, but still only have 90% of the songs I'm looking for. Slowly adding more so in sure at some point I will have them all, but until then.. 4 stars"
"November 20, 2016","Can't seem to get the PC application to work consistently and right. Freezes and crashes when you're trying to add music at this point."
"September 24, 2017","Lots of great choices"
"April 28, 2017","Great selection of music. Love Amazon Music! Great streaming quality no interruptions."
"June 3, 2016","Doesn't have everything you might be looking for"
"April 3, 2016","I've downloaded 400+songs and have never had a problem, except when I filled up my SD card. I had no trouble downloading to the SD card, finding music I wanted, or listening to it. I'm happy."
"September 1, 2015","My lovely jukebox, love it!"
"August 22, 2016","I AM SOOOO EXCITED ABOUT THE LIBRARY. I have been able to replace a lot of my music collection that I have lost. This APP made me enjoy my workout even more."
"November 27, 2015","It took me a while to figure out how to do all the downloading, etc., as this is my first Android mobile phone. I love the music, wonderful sound, an expansive variety of genres to choose from, (or, from which to choose)."
"November 5, 2016","There is a decent selection of songs, especially free ones if you are a prime member. The 'play again' icon does not work most of the time."
"November 26, 2014","As much as I love lots of things offered by Amazon, its Prime Music's desktop version sucks. So much inferior to other widely-known streaming platforms. The design of its Android app is also stupid, in that I'm required to switch my phone's default language from Chinese to English to be able to use it."
"July 9, 2015","I just absolutely LOVE Amazon Music, and with the added benefit of the Prime Music it's just wonderful!!! It's so easy to use and shop. The songs and albums are very affordable and you can't even imagine all the free music available with Prime. Love it!!!"
"November 23, 2014","have not used it enough to know"
"December 31, 2016","I enjoy Amazon music... The station choices are excellent and I like having free music available to add to my listening library."
"September 10, 2016","Lots of material gaps. For example tears for fears was there, but the album sowing the seeds of love was. Other pay services have their entire catalog."
"September 27, 2016","I think its nice. It downloads quickly for u. U can pick singles or the albums. U can even go by the artist if u want. Its a pretty cool little app."
"September 10, 2016","Another Excellent benefit of being a Prime member. No commercials, outstanding choices available, just wish I could get the app for my Visio smart TV."
"June 19, 2015","never works, my music library clears itself once in a while. ""your music library is empty"", when I reinstall the app then I get my songs back, then they disappear.  tried on multiple phones, app is slow and a pain to use. would not recommend"
"October 1, 2016","Easy to use"
"May 31, 2016","Easy to use, excellent quality. This is one heck of a product! I have recommended it to ALL of my family and friends and have absolutely NO HESITATION recommending to anyone"
"September 1, 2017","They had music that I love & it was easy for this old lady to download."
"September 10, 2017","After i purchased songs they wouldn't play kept skipping or wouldnt play without internet service. I wasted money"
"October 4, 2015","LOVE Amazon Prime Music! The 90's alternative playlist is great & unlike other music apps, it actually plays music I recognize from the 90's. I love that I can download songs and play them when I don't have wifi to save my data. A+++"
"May 25, 2016","Amazon music is better then other app out there. The fact that no commercials or interruptions on stations is great. Lots of options when choosing playlist, and music of choice."
"September 28, 2016","Awesome!!!!"
"November 6, 2014","One my kids used to download their own mp3's here before u had to try to make more by MAKING EVERYTHING AMAZON INTO PRIME! As did I! And let me say, we have 6 kindles plus 5 phones & 3 computers that all access our shared kindle account! So we can keep track of what our kids read view listen to access via the net & download!! Via EACH KIMDLE APP & DEVCE HOUSE HOLD WIDE! THESE DEVICES TREK TO SCHOOL! T SPORTS PRACTICE! T EVERY FIELD TRIP ALL IVER THE PLACE! T OVER NIGHT FRIENDS HOUSES ! NOW, TO SAY AT THE LEAST WE'D BE QUITE NUTS TO EVER ATTACH A CREDIT IR DEBIT CARD number SUCH AN ACCOUNT! SO WE ALWAYS WENT ON GIFT CARD AT A TME TO INSURE NOTHING WENT WRONG! AND IT WORKED FINE! IT STILL DOES FOR APPS AND BOOKS BUT NO LONGER CAN WE BUY ANY MUSIC AT ALL. MY TEENS HAVE CHUNKED $600 BUCKS WORTH OF KINDLES IN THE CLOSET TO ROT! USELESS TO THEM IF THEY CAN'T DO IT ALL IN ONE more PLACE! U NEED TO RETHINK THIS LAST GREAT MOVE AMAZON. AND IF U DONT THINK WE LOVE U.. MY CAR PLATES READ... KINDLME!! NO FLIPPING JOKE!"
"November 21, 2015","This app is way better than most of the competitors out there. I also have rhapsody and it is horrible unless your somewhere that has a strong wifi signal. This app actually works sometimes with just the mobile network."
"June 10, 2015","Have found new music, as well as most of my old favorites. The play lists are great too. So Much music, so little time! I bet if I turned my selections on and just let them play it would take days to finish. Just love that! Thank you Cheers"
"December 22, 2012","Integration is great I love that you can actually stream music from the cloud unlike iTunes match. Match uses a cache folder and stores music as it is playing. I just wish amazon would provide a desktop option for this app so you did not have to use the browser. If there was a user friendly desktop interface like iTunes they would have five stars. Keep working on it amazon you have my business, I hope you continue to develope your music products."
"May 29, 2017","I couldn't try because you dont accept saudi credit card"
"August 28, 2017","Works well on Pixel"
"September 17, 2017","Great music veriety"
"May 29, 2017","Must have I love it"
"June 7, 2016","I listen to my Amazon music more than iTunes."
"April 28, 2016","So many albums and playlists to choose from in all genres, and all for free as a member! I use both video and music-a really good deal for less than $10 a month now, in my first year."
"June 25, 2017","I like it a lot compared to other apps. Wish I could add whole albums to playlist."
"April 28, 2017","Clearly presented, a large variety, and easy access to historical music and legendary artist😙😙😙"
"July 19, 2017","Just started using music, so far not bad. Its not the latest selling singles but hey, way cheaper."
"July 18, 2017","I would like to hear more obscure songs instead of the most popular ones. Otherwise, pretty good."
"July 11, 2016","I really like this, better than Pandora because you can choose music. I don’t use spotify, but it seems like a similar service and it was free with my amazon prime!"
"July 19, 2017","I would give 5 stars but you don't provide enough smooth jazz artists."
"August 4, 2016","why it so hard to get music"
"December 26, 2015","I'm just starting to use this app, so far so good, but not convinced it's better than Pandora"
"June 19, 2016","Free music, sometime selection is limited"
"April 26, 2016","All the features available exceeded my expectations -- from lyrics, to instant downloads (after a purchase of physical copies of music) to the display and layout of the music library."
"June 27, 2015","ok"
"June 2, 2016","Not enough access to oldies for us older guys."
"May 25, 2016","Commercial free Radio. Skip any number of times. Many different genres to choose from. Amazon Music is better than Pandora, better than Spotify, and better than Sound Cloud."
"October 7, 2015","Tons of songs, albums and artists. Easy to navigate.....hardly uses any data on my mobile. Commercial free and I can skip songs as many times as I want. This app was worth paying for prime by itself, not to mention the other perks!"
"November 12, 2011","Pros: plays DRM-free mp3 files with few hitches. Nice integration with the Amazon mp3 store. Cons: long, frequent lags occur with automatic refreshes of a large (18K song) music library; sometimes these result in corrupt data and I have to clear data and download the whole library metadata again. No gapless playback. Uploader and service won't allow uploading of edited tags or direct tag edits. Uploader is slow to scan files and doesn't handle changes to playlists well."
"January 23, 2015","Sluggish and halting. It does not allow for personalized sorting of music. Well, that is not exactly true, you can organize your music which the application will completely forget the next time you start it. The app is the only way to enjoy the free prime content, so it pretty much sucks."
"December 23, 2016","Overall this app is competitive with Spotify and Play Music, and definitely blows Napster (Formerly Rhapsody) out of the proverbial water. It does have its pitfalls however. The biggest of which is the fact that MP3s you've already downloaded will be miscategorized. Also I've found that although the option does exist to download play lists the songs will not show up in the ""Downloaded"" section. Secondly, the music you purchase is not transferable across other platforms. Simply put, of I purchase a song outright I feel it is my right to download said song in a universal format such as .MP3. User interface is easy to navigate, and I have yet to come across an artist that is not in the ""Unlimited"" category. Anyway, I gave it a try for 1 week and have decided to switch back to Spotify premium. In my opinion the extra $2 per month is worth it."
"June 27, 2016","I like the amount of genres selection."
"July 18, 2015","I downloaded Prime Music on Prime Day and just love it! Enjoy all the playlists that Amazon's created that make it super easy to pick several favorite songs in a similar genre. Can't wait to download more music so that I can ROCK my upcoming vacay!"
"June 15, 2014","how crazy is that? I bet Kindle Fire owners version 1 will never get new version.  A pioneer with arrows in his back!!!! I have 3 version 1 kindles. Loyal customer???"
"March 2, 2016","Really like the playlists and stations. Would be good if more recent stuff was included but when you look what you are paying for Amazon Prime and all the other benefits, not bad value for money."
"April 19, 2014","I bought a Zune MP3 player years ago, and I hate how they demand that you pay $150 a year for the service. I didn't remember to get online and order new songs every month, and wasted my money. I am SO happy with this app. Now I can listen to my favorite music anytime, and I don't have to pay a ridiculous amount (or anything at all) to use this service."
"August 18, 2016","easily accessible to music with extensive categories making obtaining desired music and purchasing completely stress free. Loves me some amazon prime music"
"June 13, 2016","The shipping is very fast. Thank very much"
"July 21, 2015","We enjoy being able to listen to our downloaded/purchased songs via Bluetooth in the car! Lets me choose what songs my kids can listen to."
"June 18, 2015","My last CD order was damaged (CD case only). Amazon is currently refunding $12.96 but I decided to keep CD because I like it and found another case for it. Please keep the $12.96! I could not find a way to ""cancel"" my ""cancel"". Thank you!"
"May 27, 2015","Like everything Prime - Love it - I always get the chance to download the newest and full albums that I love and I am always getting notices on new singles or albums that are available for me for free because I am a prime member - what more could you ask for!!!"
"August 7, 2017","Not easy to search. Limited selection"
"December 2, 2015","Found all the old CD's I purchased from Amazon over the last 15 years and loaded all. Excellent as I forgot about some of them. Amazon did not, even though Amazon Music player did not exist in the way back."
"June 22, 2016","The only complaint I have is at times it lags & the buffering wheel just inherently spins... waiting for that hamster to croak. The other complaints have nothing to do with the app or Amazon. There are a lot of obscure groups that I listen to, most of which are not in the library. some of the groups I like aren't allowing their material to be offered to stream. Therefore, THEY, groups like Metallica, can pucker up and... well, let's keep this age appropriate & kid friendly. Be prepared for music streaming to suck up some data. I use this while at work with my Bluetooth & it keeps the OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD voices in the office masked. I use it while mowing the lawn with my Beats which makes that 1 1/2 hour go by REALLY fast. This app is well worth the time to install and the music you can find from your favorite artists is worth searching for. Once you build your streaming library, it's an awesome tool to have for those ""I NEED SOME METAL TO SHUT THIS @$$&%$ UP"" moments."
"June 20, 2014","Not quite as good as I expected. I expected more, if not all ""free"" music. I would think my $99 per year would allow me to also download free music. There are many music players out there with free streaming, and some (Tunee) with free downloads."
"July 9, 2015","Not quite as good as Google Play Music as far as subscription services go, but it is not a bad addition to Amazon Prime. Who can complain about free music, let's be honest, I purchased prime for the shipping aspect, not the instant video or the music."
"August 15, 2015","With prime I can download every song I want to listen to, no ads, not a limited number of skips every hour. Everything from old school to modern music. Wish this would have come out earlier. Iheartradio and definitely Pandora you're slacking."
"June 3, 2016","I enjoy listening to my music when near WIFI"
"October 8, 2015","Amazon only work with music you have previously downloaded or installed in your phone..I was looking for a particular artist and when I searched him amazon kept coming up but the songs I was looking for was not on amazon at all.."
"February 9, 2016","So far I like it, the lyrics are a bit off but that's no big deal I know most of the lyrics to the songs I like the repeat feature because sometimes I get interrupted and only catch part of the song."
"June 24, 2015","Easy to use but requires some improvements: - Exit option. Application still running all the time. - Usage of SD card storage. Currently the application use device storage to keep offline music. A few albums will full device space. Offline files are DRM protected. They could be stored in SD without any problem. - Clear SD space. After removing offline music the application does not remove files from storage. - Optimize memory consumption. I own a Samsung S4. This application use more memory than similar applications, reaching almost 100% memory usage.  I hope Amazon implement these improvements soon."
"December 30, 2016","As a prime member this app is the bees knees for streaming music! I love that you can listen to entire albums or playlists."
"April 5, 2016","Nice"
"June 24, 2016","Love the Prime music. Great stations"
"July 10, 2015","I have been a prime member for several years and just love Amazon Music with Prime Music! It allows me to control my music library! I can add complete albums or parts of! I play it through my Sonos System throughout the house! Love it!"
"July 22, 2015","Having Amazon Prime is so very worthwhile! Prime Music is another one of the benefits that comes with your membership. I love the app!!"
"August 1, 2015","I love the Amazon music app. I especially like when it provides lyrics to the songs. It's always worked well on my Samsung Galaxy S4."
"August 28, 2017","I like the music, but dislike that I can't download it to my phone."
"March 4, 2016","Amazon let's me listen to my music while on the go. It comes in handy in the Dr's waiting office, at the gym and really anytime I have some spare time when I am away from home. I love the app."
"June 25, 2016","We Listen to the Music all the time!"
"March 18, 2015","Make this app movable to sd card storage! Make songs downloadable to sd card storage! Will be deleting until I see this app fixed. No more mp3 shopping from amazon until then."
"May 1, 2015","I'm sure it would work wonderfully if I had unlimited data or maybe if I was using an amazon device. But for my galaxy, I find that it consumes too much memory and streams away my data. I uninstalled for this reason."
"February 1, 2017","A great way to music to a broader audience. I've discovered lots of new entertainers through the ""Recommendations""."
"July 18, 2015","Amazon prime music app still needs to be polished up. It is not very intuitive. It does not always do what I was expecting. Also I would like to make a station a favorite but wasn't clear if that can be done. Once again not a well thought out app."
"December 23, 2015","Keeps telling me &#34;currently unavailable&#34; when I try to download this. I am a prime member and have been a loyal Amazon user for a very long time. Please fix this issue so I can have my music!!!"
"March 26, 2015","this app needs work, especially if you use the Echo app with it, they get confused and sometimes the Amazon Music app will fail to work. The only fix I've found is to reboot the phone, simply killing the app and restarting doesn't work. This is on a Moto X running Android."
"August 6, 2016","What's not to love. All my purchased music in my library, and I love the playlists. I've discovered some really good music playing the different playlists."
"June 20, 2016","good service just not enough in prime"
"July 7, 2016","Never got to use it yet fully!!!"
"April 7, 2015","This app has really changed the way I listen to music. So many choices and so little time! For the first few days I spent more time looking through all the music that was available than I did listening to the music. Definitely one of the things that makes Amazon Prime a good deal."
"April 11, 2015","I love streaming music with amazon. Getting whole albums at a time is so much easier than trying to figure things out song by song. There is such a wide selection of prime music that is free for the listening. I am glad that I finally decided to give it a try. Love it!"
"July 30, 2017","not available in my country"
"January 23, 2016","Great selection and easy to use. I have been wanting something like this to listen to music for a while now. This fits the bill perfectly. There are no ads to deal with like other apps I have tried."
"September 7, 2015","No commercials. And it's more Direct than Pandora Radio. I love it. My uncle showed this to me. I use it all the time now."
"July 31, 2016","I have only had this app a few days but so far I love it and so does my family! All the songs we can add to our library for free with prime has been great."
"December 4, 2016","Better than iTunes. I had iTunes and they were limited and you had to buy a lot of albums or songs.. MUSIC has a good variety"
"February 17, 2016","Copy the user interface and functionality of Slacker and I'll be happier."
"February 2, 2017","I purchased PRIME for the music and video. When these were separated I lost interest. I have a used Alexa for sale now!"
"January 29, 2017","Terrible to install, and if you have more than one device on your account, almost impossible to install on another device."
"April 2, 2016","Amazon Music as a Prime member is fantastic!!! I listen from my Samsung Note 5 for the most part! I was a Pandora subscriber, but with Amazon Prime, there are SO many other benefits!"
"September 4, 2017","Great Prime feature for hours of music."
"December 24, 2014","Prime Music is the best thing I am getting other than free shipping with my Prime memberships. The playlists are way better than Iheart or Panndora on top of that all the awesome free albums from so many categories including even Christian music and Latino. It has become my only music app."
"August 2, 2016","I like that Prime comes with free music streaming. The app for whatever reason is crashes a lot on my OnePlus Two to the point that I've given up using it."
"October 3, 2017","Love this app!"
"July 22, 2015","This is awesome. NO MORE PANDORA COMMERCIALS!!!!! I am so happy to be an amazon prime member - great benefits and this is one of them."
"October 5, 2017","I would make it 5 stars but there is music groups i love that are not on the music that plays"
"June 17, 2016","Love it. It's so good and convenient."
"January 2, 2016","I am using a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 tablet and a Samsung Galaxy S4 and the volume on both keeps decreasing to zero. Both devices? I think a bug fix is in order. As a reminder, this is not a free service."
"June 22, 2017","I love it no interceptions"
"May 21, 2017","this app SUCKS!!!!! You can;t upload anything- it just circles and circles and circles. You can't figure out how to download a new version, it just takes you to this stupid page where you can add it to your cart!! Just put a damn manual upload button on the page for God's sake!!! whoever designed this app should be fired immediately!!!!! For all the money they have, they surely have crappy software engineers!"
"July 25, 2015","Really like this so far. Not quite as intuitive as pandora but no commercials and ability to skip multiple songs makes this worth it."
"September 28, 2015","I have just gotten started with my Prime membership and I am simply stunned at all the available offers that come with this subscription. I am so thankful that to be a Prime member and can't wait to fully utilize my membership."
"July 31, 2014","This app crashes every time I try to play music from Amazon Prime."
"February 28, 2016","Way too much time buffering if your trying to stream. Also takes forever to build a playlist off of a desktop or laptop computer. Three times faster to do the same actions from a smart phone."
"September 2, 2016","I love amazon music, everything is want to hear is right at my finger tips, would definitely recommend this app to anyone who has amazon prime !!!"
"May 24, 2016","Just tried this app about 3 days ago and I love all the choices of music that it offers. I have been using this app a lot since I got it. I would recommend it to everyone."
"January 18, 2017","There's something for everybody in this app! I find brand new hits and artists, that I would never expect to, so quickly!"
"March 21, 2017","Love it, just needs more updated music"
"October 31, 2017","Great benefit of being a prime member."
"August 5, 2015","Great. Was able to synch my ITunes songs to Amazon Music and then to Amazon cloud and I was able to stream them on my new phone!"
"June 10, 2016","Love Amazon music! So many choices..."
"October 3, 2016","Love Amazon Music. I'm a huge music lover in general but Amazon music makes it so easy to listen to and enjoy your favorite types of music."
"September 7, 2017","I downloaded app and it doesnt show up on my phone. Where is my music. Its a new phone but should come up."
"June 22, 2016","Has better music and more stations"
"February 1, 2014","This might be free to download, but I have to say it probably costs me more money to keep it just for the simple fact that it's too easy to buy songs with it. Over all its great because I can access my purchased songs, there are no adds, and finding songs are just as easy. Maybe one day they can add it a song finder where the app listens, and finds the song?"
"January 3, 2017","Excellent selection of music."
"June 11, 2016","Alot of music, free to prime members."
"January 7, 2016","Would have been better if the Prime membership has all of the benefits for all in the same house holdi think they give it to 3 household members which is fine, but the free music is only for the member."
"April 28, 2017","The site is a little difficult to use. Could be a little More user friendly."
"April 13, 2015","Prime music does not play on my Samsung Galaxy tab 4! I simply can not understand why? I tried almost everything but still it wont play. I downloaded Android version but no avail. My iMac and Mac book pro retina play beautifully but not on Samsung tab 4. I gave up."
"September 27, 2017","Listening Now. It was fast to download and has a ton of music to choose from. So glad I downloaded today."
"January 19, 2016","Great selection of music that can be saved to the cloud or a device. Very good"
"September 1, 2014","Since the most recent update this app has become unusable and useless. As soon as you open the app it freezes and causes a forced close. It is so bad that it makes Google's MP3 music player look like geniuses created it. Please fix this payer or make the previous version available until you fix this horrible app."
"September 14, 2015","Uses to use Pandora but now on all my rides (Motorcycle) I listen to Prime Music. It plays all the tracks I've asked it too and adds some really good tracks that compliment my list as opposed to other apps that just toss them in."
"February 27, 2016","I've been using it for a couple weeks and so far I love it. I love being able to stream a whole album if that's what I feel like doing. Or using the suggested playlists are pretty good too."
"June 14, 2016","Being a member has great advantages"
"July 17, 2016","This doesn't work at all."
"August 2, 2012","Amazon cloud where all your music is stored with unlimited space was supposed to be free with my Kindle Fire. plus I'm already paying $70 a year for Amazon Prime! The Google Music Manager still has unlimited space for free (or when you purchase music from them). that's where I will be headed when Amazon says my time is up, rather than getting nickled and dimed to death and having to choose and upload those 25 songs. Bah bye, Amazon. my next tablet won't be a Kindle."
"May 29, 2017","Love it.!!!"
"June 7, 2016","Better than Spotify of course no ads."
"January 19, 2016","Enjoying it as an extra form of entertainment while driving in my car or home."
"June 13, 2016","Really not much in the way of jazz."
"July 9, 2015","Thousands of songs to download on your cloud and play anywhere. Multiple genres and all the functions of iTunes. Make your own playlists.so easy and best of all is free with your Prime membership. Makes the $90 a year a little easier to accept."
"September 14, 2014","It still let's me queue up music to download, and indicates that it is doing so, but attempting to play things that have been &#34;downloaded&#34; just causes the app to crash. The songs don't show up in other media players either. Also, it looks like this app is no longer available in the play store."
"March 24, 2015","This has seriously changed my life.I love Amazon more and more everyday! I can't compare it to another music service because this is the only one I've used. I have the app on my phone. It is super easy to use and set up. The library of music is very extensive. I have found almost every song I have ever loved and added it. You can listen by playlists that you make yourself or pre-made playlists. You can listen by album or artist too. I really love having this."
"August 28, 2016","Love my amazon music with prime app!!! Wish they had more envy on the coast but all in all I am a fan and don't use any other music apps anymore."
"June 25, 2016","Great product and fast delivery"
"November 3, 2016","I'm still looking for a few of my favorite singers like Anita Baker, Miki Howard, Randy Crawford and many more that I didn't see."
"March 23, 2016","Amazon sent the link but it won't download to my Windows Phone (get a message that says the link is not working). Any tips would be appreciated... I really want this app on my phone."
"June 2, 2016","A great extra to being a prime member!"
"August 5, 2015","This service is... not good.  At the current rate, it will never compete with pandora, spotify, iheart, or any other music service. Not much of the music I want to hear, without buying it specifically through amazon. I'll pass."
"October 15, 2015","With a household of users it is difficult to separate newly purchased music from a mobile device. If my husband buys music and I download newly purchased items, I get his music on my device. It's not that user friendly"
"July 15, 2016","The music selection is excellent. The interface took a little getting use to, but was no problem. The benefits of Prime are outstanding. Totally worth it!"
"May 30, 2016","Love all the music on here. Not much so far that I haven't been able to find. The only thing with downloading songs...my phone updated and all the songs were gone :("
"September 28, 2017","So easy and I create all my different play list."
"February 24, 2015","I was really excited about getting more music through Amazon because i have prime. But all I'm getting is a bunch of disappointment. This useless app sends me a crash notice about every 2 hours and constantly froze when i did try and use it. Looks like ill keep using apple."
"June 6, 2017","Pretty good. Wish there was more music available for free with prime though."
"June 25, 2014","This is one of the best amazon apps out there. You have the option of storing music in the cloud or on your phone. And now with prime, you can get many free albums or songs for free. Such an amazing addition to an amazing online shopping website. Music doesn't skip or buffer when stored in the cloud. Sound quality is amazing."
"December 11, 2014","Not nearly enough songs available as Rhapsody and you can only download to your computer if you purchase them, also unlike Rhapsody. Many songs you purchase do not include an accurate description. I won't be renewing my subscription at the end of my year. I will be going back to Rhapsody."
"December 7, 2016","Never coordinated correctly with iTunes and Alexa. Alexa rarely would play songs I KNOW I added to my personal library."
"December 16, 2014","If you have 8 gb total on the internal storage and 32 gb of external storage (sd), you want to put large files, like music, on the external card. When I ran out of internal storage I checked the apps using the most storage: Amazon music, Amazon Kindle and the Amazon app were the top 3 and none have the option to move storage to the external sd, that I found. I uninstalled all three and all is good. It's a shame, but Amazon sure seems out of touch with what customers want and need for large file storage."
"August 29, 2017","Lots of free options with a tremendous variety."
"September 7, 2017","Awesome!!"
"February 16, 2016","It's free but didn't want to have to download music to use more data on my phone thought I could just purchase music how I wanted, confused, bought other music without joining another link."
"December 9, 2016","Great music selections and easy to access via Echo... get Amazon Prime and you are set for a positive music experience."
"August 10, 2016","Great"
"August 10, 2017","Seriously the best thing that has ever happened to music. Love it so much. This is awesome thank you"
"October 9, 2015","I am actually disappointed with Amazon Prime Music, which is odd because everything else Amazon has touched is basically gold. The app crashes and the buffering time is awful. I am waiting for some sort of update or fix."
"November 9, 2014","Not only is the app itself difficult to navigate and completely the opposite of intuitive, now it has started crashing as soon as it opens. I switched from Slacker and started paying for a Prime membership to avoid the lags and crashing issues with Slacker, so I'm extremely irritated with this."
"August 10, 2015","Amazon Prime is good thank you very much and i like it. So keep the good work. Tank you, Yamil. Have a nice night."
"October 27, 2016","Really like this app to select music easily - great variety. Then I just ask Alexa to play whatever album, playlist, etc I want."
"March 25, 2014","Is nice that i can download any MP3 purchase directly to my Android Tablet, instead of having to hookup the USB cable and transfer it that way. Makes it easier to just move it to the Tablet when I purchase it, instead of forgetting to do so until I start looking for the track to listen to, and then realize i didn't move it over yet. Nice App."
"December 9, 2014","Well i defently liked the service in the beginning but when i got a new phone i can not figure out how to load my 500 or so songs that i paid for onto my new phone. There in my Amazon account on my computer. But will not load into my new phone. This sucks because i spent alot of money"
"August 28, 2016","This is a great add-on service for us. Driving down the road, wanting to hear some old album? OPpen Amazon music and stream via BT to your car!"
"December 28, 2016","I have a tablet connected to my Bose stereo system via blue tooth. I stream Amazon music and the sound is fantastic."
"April 10, 2015","Prime would be great if the encrypted files would download to the card instead. My phone stays constantly full and I have to delete music to add any more. I already buy so much music that I wanted prime so I could check out what I haven't heard but what a hassle"
"August 11, 2016","love this app.. Once I learned how much free music and even stand up comedy it came with, I never had to be bored while wrapping up my shift again"
"June 22, 2014","great streaming option for desktops. I have not tried the mobile phone streaming app yet, but if it works as slickly as the desktop streaming this will be a nice option.  Only thing I don't like is there is a pause between songs. Might be nice if it matched up so one song blended into the next for sound continuity."
"November 27, 2014","If i could give it less than 1 star, i would. God i hate this app. I kept buying the same album and trying to play it but it never showed up in my library. Literally the worst. Do not get."
"February 10, 2016","Thank God they have all of Taylor Swift's albums. Which is why I love this app. (Except 1989 but I have that one in my phone)"
"December 20, 2014","Sorry you ran me away from purchasing music. It is interesting that this dept really wants the site to fail. Your customers should not have to go through crap to spend their hard earned money with you or enjoy a service that you offered. It was not broken WHY DID YOU TRY TO FIX IT!!!!"
"February 4, 2016","This is another good thing about Amazon Prime being able todownload music with much included with prime membership, lwith the plus being you can download and listen offline at no extra cost."
"June 14, 2016","great for in the car on the road"
"March 29, 2015","Fabulous music greatest selection ever! Mom is 94 yrs. And sang and danced her heart out! It was wonderful to see (even though she had had a stroke recently!)"
"August 3, 2017","What's not to like? Free music streaming. You can't beat it with a stick."
"May 29, 2013","This app used to work great about 3 updates back, but now it is terrible! Shuffle just plays the same set of songs over and over despite adding new music to the library. If you skip a song, the app thinks you are still on the old song and plays the previous track from cache as the track you just skipped to. The interface is so so. I'm looking for a different app to play my music from. This one just sucks."
"April 25, 2016","Absolutely love the amazon Prime music!! I would have given it 5 stars, but the Amazon website makes it so complicated to find the Prime Music that I get frustrated by it."
"July 21, 2017","All I listen to now!"
"April 9, 2017","Loving all the music"
"March 2, 2016","Think its cool never had music on my phone or computer ,but my kids did . Amazon made it easy can't wait to show kids i'm cool too ,or groovy or bad whatever the saying is these days ."
"September 6, 2017","Any genre I'm in the mood for, any time. Fantastic service!"
"August 6, 2015","I love being able to get free music and albums. I love the stations on here and that you can have as many skips as you want!"
"January 24, 2017","I have been trying to put this app I have on my other devices on to my Surface pro. Just cant see how to do it?????"
"June 17, 2014","I have an Android tablet with OS 4.0.4...this is SUPPOSED to run on Android tablets running OS 2.0 or higher....NOT!!!! And as others have written, you can't download any of this music onto an SD card to put into your tablet or phone. I don't know about you, but I prefer to store photos & music on an SD card so as to not fill up the device's memory unnecessarily. Personally, I don't like to tote a laptop around just to listen to music, and I have an awesome stereo in the house, so unless I can use this on my tablet, why bother???? So this is now a 100% useless service I am paying for. Besides raising the annual fee $20 a year, it's just another reason to not renew my Amazon Prime membership."
"April 18, 2015","Finally was able to get my husband up and running with something simple to play music from his phone. Works great and he is feeling quite smart and a bit more caught up with the times. There is music for any kind of taste or mood you might find yourself in!"
"November 20, 2016","An excellent app! Great way to listen to purchased music and Prime Music! No lag or stuttering, as some other music apps."
"June 5, 2016","Great thing. No service no problem"
"September 2, 2015","I only wish I was able access it without wifi when I'm outside running....only downfall other than that it's awesome"
"November 16, 2016","Great music service. As a Prime member I have access to so many great songs.  Easy and intuitive, unlike iTunes."
"January 6, 2016","what's not to like - sure it's not always the latest releases, but for seemingly unlimited playlists and a huge library it's an added bonus feature of prime. great alternative to xm, etc."
"July 22, 2015","I have this on my Samsung Galaxy 4 tablet and stream the music on my desk. People come in dancing. I haven't played with it too much but I'd like to select several different genres and have it randomly play selections from all of them."
"April 16, 2017","great music app has everything you want in a app runs smoothe and steady"
"April 28, 2015","Got Prime? Gotta have this. It's great not having to rely on a browser, and all the resources they can eat up. It's pretty lightweight, cross-platform (Windows and Android - GET ON LINUX!), and is a pretty solid, if basic, player even without Amazon music."
"January 22, 2014","This used to be my main MP3 player on Android. It was never great, but it worked. Most recent updates have made it annoying to use as just a player. The initial screen is a selection screen to go to the store or player. You can't bypass this anymore. There are so many better players out there that this pushed it off my phone and tablet. Uninstalled."
"June 3, 2016","PERFECT ANY SONG I WANT IT'S THERE"
"October 2, 2016","I love Prime music, now that I have had a chance to play with it...I will probably update to 5 stars if crashing issues are resolved."
"June 26, 2016","Good product for the price."
"November 13, 2016","So far, downloading Amazon Prime music has been very easy. Being computer illiterate, it's nice to find something I can do."
"April 1, 2015","Love the addition of Prime Music. Super easy to use, a great selection of songs (including some of our blues favorites which are hard to find on some sites) and it automatically sends everything to your cloud...an all around great deal with my Prime membership!"
"June 19, 2016","Easy to use, great selection!"
"December 22, 2016","So easy to use and all the music from my pc was switched over and available on my other devices. Love,love,love it"
"June 8, 2015","Okay so I love this app. I love it. It's Spotify but I don't have to pay extra and on top of that it includes music already on my phone. BUT today it logged me out and when I logged back in my offline playlists were deleted. Bug they have to fix."
"November 15, 2016","Nice service but they push a lot of stuff I'm not interested in... Maybe I just haven't found the right preferences menu."
"September 20, 2016","Can't get it to work. All of a sudden MY kindle doesn't play music, my computer no problem. Amazon works even after the Windows update."
"March 20, 2017","Will never be without music again! Love it!!"
"October 19, 2016","I liked the old version better. This is like Groove on windows 10, but the response time is slower and interface is not as good."
"June 11, 2015","Great features. There is a lot of options (prime, cloud, device) I switched from Rhapsody and a little disappointed in there free to add to library select for Prime members. Out of 200 songs on Rhapsody I will have to buy over 50 in Amazon music"
"July 23, 2016","Not easy to get to"
"June 20, 2016","More music than I imagined !"
"March 11, 2016","Enjoying a wide variety of music genre now and not having to pay for each one individually unless I want to own it out right. Otherwise it is covered by my Amazon Prime membership."
"November 11, 2017","Crashes on my pc quite a bit. Some things saved to my music is unavailable unless bought over time."
"January 29, 2016","Love that you cam download the latest music with your Prime Account! Awesome!"
"September 25, 2015","Very impressed with the selection and genres - how intuitive the app is at identifying songs based on what I like. The option to add to the cloud, a group I specify or download to my phone with unlimited skips amazed me!"
"July 24, 2015","It's ok if you are looking for something specific and they have the title. Would be nice to look for genre choices so I can hear something new or not discovered. I have Google music which is much better for music in my humble opinion.."
"May 23, 2017","Amazing selection!"
"April 18, 2015","A wonderful feature of Prime. It alone is worth the Prime membership fee. I have already saved a bunch of money I would have spent on iTunes. Go for it."
"August 17, 2015","It was added to an already fine membership. I've saved hundreds of hours to my account, I haven't listened to many hours yet.  Amazon now lets me for free, in my mind because of the overall value of my Prime membership."
"September 23, 2014","Crashes when I'm not even using it. A royal pain!"
"June 9, 2016","Limited inventory and dated UX."
"April 13, 2015","Love it."
"June 12, 2016","Love the combination of music."
"July 8, 2016","It sux. Does not work!"
"October 28, 2014","My phone is Android Chinese, does not work, I change it for another - a cell phone or do not work, I used to buy at Amazon mp3 does not work, do not feel happy, I hope to correct as soon as possible"
"July 18, 2015","What an AWESOME collection of music for Amazon Prime Members to enjoy for free."
"March 29, 2016","It is the best music app! You can listen to your music offline. I think that is the best part! You can get the music you like for free! You put the app on several devices too!"
"July 6, 2015","This app makes getting my music so easy! AND!!! You cannot beat Prime music for their selections. Love,love,love!"
"March 29, 2016","It is musically wonderful, but it's an almost useless app considering it will NOT update, & will NOT stop notifying me to update. Has crashed my HTC twice upon RE-downloading."
"June 16, 2014","First the selection of artist and music is very limited unless you like Billy Joel or some of the other artist who show up everywhere.Second when i try to down load to my kindle fire it says it's not compatible.  So for me 1 star"
"March 10, 2015","Love Amazon prime~ I listen to all sorts of music I would not otherwise try!"
"May 15, 2017","I need more time,i just started using this app 2 days ago.So far i am enjoying this,i love music.."
"March 2, 2016","Kind of clunky menu. Wishing it was easier to navigate. I guess I'm comparing to Pandora more than anything. Be more like Pandora Amazon Music! I love not having commercials though."
"October 7, 2015","I always find with Chvrches that it take a few listens to really get into each song, but once I do and all the smaller details start to become apparent, well... they arent my favorite band for nothing! Awesome album!"
"March 10, 2016","Good musiv variety although they make it very difficult to put app on Android and am not able to get it working at all on Kindle which is very surprising as uts an amazon product."
"June 9, 2017","Best app to use for music when you have the subscription"
"June 16, 2016","The sound quality is lit fam"
"March 22, 2016","A bargain no matter what your download preferences are. Sure, there are artists that I would like to see on the free side, but at the price of Prime membership.....Enough said."
"January 25, 2017","Dial up the music you like. Not all music is available, but there is enough to make you happy. No commercials."
"March 22, 2016","I don't understand why I can get Prime stations on my HTC One A9 phone, but not on my Kindle Fire HD, which is manufactured by Amazon. Fix this, and this app will get 5 stars."
"May 10, 2016","Haven't got to explore much yet but like the lyrics option on most songs. I like that I could download it on my windows computer as well so I could connect to my TV."
"June 5, 2016","Worth the price of Prime alone."
"March 8, 2016","Love that I can use this app on multiple devices. From desktop to laptop to table and even cell phone,I can access my music and listen anywhere,anytime. Good quality sound for me."
"October 10, 2017","Love it"
"March 29, 2016","Love it except for the part that it freezes when I listen to it in my car through Bluetooth. Can't be the Internet because Pandora plays smoothly. Other than that it's great."
"March 8, 2016","This App rocks! I have it on my S5, my 2 in 1 Dell Laptop, my Kindle Fire, my work computer, I have never had a problem with this App (knock on wood) Awesome Job Amazon!!!! <3"
"June 21, 2016","Great variety with no ads!"
"June 10, 2015","I was hoping Prime music was going to be the answer to what service I should use since I was already paying for Prime, but it won't work with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 android tablet. Very disappointed. Will probably have to go with Spotify."
"June 14, 2016","User friendly and intuitive."
"February 20, 2015","No problems with downloading any music. Creating ""playlist"" is a breeze. Downloaded the ""Amazon Music"" app for my Galaxy S5 and can play my music any where at any time. I use Media Monkey on my PC but this is my go-to app when I'm away from my desktop."
"July 31, 2016","Selection of free songs is very limited. Couldn't find any of my music. I'd have to buy them. I'll be sticking with Google Play for all my music."
"June 10, 2016","So much better than iTunes!!!"
"January 6, 2013","If this app came on your phone only your carrier can decide if you can remove it or not. Sprint did not preload this app on my phone. I chose to download and use it. I found I could move the app to the SD card on my phone. It works just fine there. I play music stored on my SD card far more than the stuff on my cloud drive. I like this app. I don't like reviews that rate apps down for issues caused by choices made by carriers."
"November 10, 2017","Wouldn't download. It just kept saying install pending."
"February 10, 2017","This is the best. Since I have Amazon Prime, I get thousands of song free! I wish I had been using this sooner."
"May 12, 2015","Better than Pandora (I'm with Pandora since they started) because you can listen to any song you want, fast forward, go back while the song is playing, repeat a song that you like (as many times as you want) and you can even make your own playlists."
"September 17, 2016","I like that I can preview a song before purchasing it. I wish that the app would not be deleted every time samsung does an up grade."
"April 10, 2016","All I can do is see that I have purchased the app and cannot download to my android device! No directions are given and it is not an automatic download! What a crappy app!"
"June 17, 2014","It's OK as an app - it does what it sets out to do, and I appreciate having some rather large albums in the cloud, rather than taking up space on my device, but: the app only opens in portrait mode, and I usually use my tablet in landscape mode. It's great to be able to listen to music while working, but it's super annoying when typing, editing spreadsheets, or doing other work (or even playing games!) to have everything in landscape EXCEPT for Amazon Music - I either have to turn my head sideways (not really comfortable) or turn the whole tablet/case/keyboard sideways (really inconvenient!)."
"September 4, 2016","I love the free prime music, really makes my $ 100 a year more worthwhile. If they started charging me I would really lower my rating."
"December 6, 2016","Love an app with no interruptions and commercials. This has all the bells and whistles for my personal enjoyment."
"June 23, 2015","Dont yet love it. Pandora remains my go to. Prime has some great attributes but not to the extent of me using it exclusively (yet)"
"July 23, 2016","I absolutely love amazon music! I love the availability and the wide variety of music choices and options available. It's one of my favorite apps!"
"May 15, 2015","it would not download my music without paying for what I have purchased in the past with the regular cloud player I was not looking to upgrade since I just received a new phone. all I would like to do is download the music I have already purchased."
"July 31, 2014","Lousy app. Buggy, freezes, and now has deleted my playlists on my device. I still have the songs, but have to rebuild playlists. Can we even import playlists from Cloud to device? Last I tried that was a no-go. I'm a major Amazon fan, have Prime, and buy most everything through Amazon. This app is lousy."
"June 20, 2014","What a perk to our already great Amazon Prime service. We have our music loaded and can play from our phones and computer. I love how almost every CD we have purchased has auto-tip, and is automatically loaded into our cloud player. We'll get hours of music enjoyment from this app. Thanks Amazon! You are the best."
"June 4, 2016","Anything you can find it here"
"May 22, 2013","I use this app constantly on my computer it is so much nicer than having to spend the computer memory space on iTunes!"
"March 27, 2016","Love it. This has replaced both Pandora and Spotify on my phone and tablet. Only negative... Lately it has decided to start every newly selected song 10 seconds into song."
"April 17, 2015","I'm having a very difficult, most times impossible, time downloading the songs, so I can listen when out of range of wifi. I have not contacted Amazon.com yet so I still may be able to fix this problem. If I get it fixed I will give it a 5 star rating."
"October 5, 2016","I wasn't sure I wanted to watch it, but got hooked after the 1st episode and finished both seasons. Looking forward to season 3."
"September 14, 2017","Great Music selections, huge variety, and easy to use!"
"January 24, 2017","Amazon music doesn't have a large variety of music. The app freezes a lot and the Jazz selection is very thin."
"January 23, 2017","Short on new music. Used to be able to download to my PC now it won't and I have to listen through my browser."
"February 4, 2017","It's not a bad music app the only thing I don't like about it is that you cannot adjust the equalizer settings"
"September 7, 2017","I like it so far. Have not had a chance to figure it out yet. I do like that I finally have music on my phone."
"July 25, 2016","Still crashes constantly. I really enjoy the playlist I've gathered in the app... but that does me no good if the app is unable to run correctly."
"October 3, 2016","As far as current and top hits are concerned you have access to EVERYONE. The app itself is smooth doesn't lag and play music seamlessly."
"May 18, 2016","Love Amazon Prime Music. just started using it and im so sad I didn't know about it before! I can listen to any song I download. Most songs are FREE!! Very nice!"
"August 27, 2016","Complicated, confusing, advertises downloads when they do not download, impossible to find a human being to assist you, a waste of money."
"July 21, 2015","does not work in Latin America, other platforms like spotify works well in Colombia, please include amazon music as soon as possible, I probably cancel my prime subscription because amazon music and video does not work in my country"
"June 19, 2016","Has a lot of music I want"
"July 19, 2016","The quantity of music available in the genre(s) of music i like (punk/heavy metal/hardcore/speed metal) is awesome. Far exceeds their competition!"
"June 21, 2016","Great selection of music"
"October 15, 2017","Just started using this but so far great"
"April 29, 2017","Just another extra from prime. Couldn't be happier with my purchase"
"September 7, 2015","Love the compilations Amazon puts together, they make it easy to just hit play and not have to search around."
"June 14, 2016","Lots music to choose from."
"June 16, 2016","Great selection of music!"
"September 18, 2016","Free service that comes with Prime. A great addition, although I don't use it as much as I use other music streaming apps/services."
"September 23, 2017","very impressed"
"September 2, 2015","I really like amazon's prime music. If I could add one thing, it would be the option to have prime create stations based on an artist. I could enter an artist name and prime could custom create a station of similar music."
"July 24, 2017","Best value going if you are currently a prime member."
"September 18, 2017","I love the music I can listen to all my kind of music"
"June 12, 2016","I love the Lyrics feature."
"January 29, 2015","works as specified ..."
"August 26, 2016","Great selection of music! Free Prime Music give the opportunity to download some albums and artists before your make a major investment."
"June 15, 2016","Excellent music selection"
"October 3, 2016","Gives me a nice selection of music and comedy. I use a Bluetooth speaker and I have tunes wherever I'm working around the house"
"April 7, 2015","Great selection, great prices, great listening app plus the flexibility of MP3 format."
"January 23, 2016","Love, love,love this sevice. I'm able to download tons of albums to my phone. They even have the Beatles now. I have had several services over the years and Amazon is by far the best. It's intuitive, and plentiful. And it's a free benefit for having a prime membership. I use it everyday and I've pretty much deleted all of the other competing apps and services. There is no competition anymore for me. Thank you Amazon."
"June 17, 2016","There's nothing like it!"
"July 6, 2015","I say its ok because the app does stream music but, very slow down load I cant find all the songs that I want and there's no adequate playlist program In other words you need to be as good as or better than Spotify"
"January 28, 2016","Love streaming music with prime. It's like having Pandora with no commercials. The bonus feature is when streaming music stations, you can save any song you like directly to your cloud."
"August 2, 2017","I'm learning how to use the features, might give it a better rating after I try it for a while"
"February 7, 2015","Love the app."
"July 18, 2015","It has a pretty decent collection of music and the variety is great. I particularity like the stations that allow you to explore music you are interested in with unlimited skips and ad free. It has definitely become an everyday app"
"November 13, 2016","This is a must have. You can have it on your phone or your PC and this works very well. I cannot live without this."
"June 20, 2016","GREAT GREAT GREAT !!!!!"
"January 5, 2017","This was the first player I didn't have issues with losing a signal and they have music options for everyone"
"May 1, 2016","Searching music is not that easy for Latin music. It would be nice if you searched one band that it tells you look at these others that are the same type of music."
"September 13, 2015","Prime Music is great! I have loads of albums in my library, and I just started using the stations streaming music from my phone through my car stereo. It's commercial free and the music choices are endless. Thank you!"
"July 6, 2013","the cloud player is a great feature on the app. i like that feature a lot and the music plays nice"
"April 26, 2015","No need of a review. Last one posted said I didn't follow the guidelines with a charger for a camera. Here you think I'll see if this makes it..."
"February 14, 2015","Good"
"August 4, 2015","This process was very simple and easy to use to get my songs at a good price. Credit amazon with a great music store."
"July 18, 2016","It's a little confusing on picking and downloading the music. Also, I don't know how to turn it off other than to restart my phone. Help!"
"July 18, 2015","I love amazon from the music to the movies and the shopping... so when I got this app I was super excited and I must say is well worth it and easy to use. ..I've already downloaded a ton of music!!! Thank you amazon for everything"
"January 8, 2013","The Amazon mp3 player is very good I like the ability to be able to access my music anywhere. The player plays nice even tone music. It sounds great. As a bonus any music that you purchase from amazon DOESN'T GO AGAINST YOUR STORAGE. This provides a nice incentive to purchase music from Amazon. All in all if you like music and like to buy music this the player to get. For a low cost you can incrase your storage"
"January 18, 2016","This app is great. I can listen to music without having to pay for it, and the channels are great as well. Also, if I skip songs, there isn't a limit like there are on some other apps."
"October 29, 2016","Great app!! I love it! There is such a good variety of music and it's easy to listen, save a playlist and download favorites!"
"January 30, 2017","I live remotely on a ranch and I love that I can play my music in offline mode when there is no connection!"
"October 20, 2016","Good amount of music.selection is good. Hope they add more song. Not a fan of the navigation. It's not easy to navigate."
"June 22, 2016","Huge variety of music"
"February 7, 2016","180 days to activate a transfer total bull I logout to use a different account to order a few songs then changed back to mine now I got to wait so I can listen to it you really suck"
"August 2, 2014","This app changed my data settings. Normally my phone is set to download over WiFi only. After this app installed , I checked my download settings and it changed to download via data. Not a very nice surprise."
"June 14, 2016","Selection is fantastic."
"June 21, 2016","Love the music choice"
"May 5, 2016","Will not upload my autorip purchase"
"May 4, 2017","Love it. Better than using sirius xm."
"December 8, 2014","Downloaded app x1, bought wonderful music (Portguese Fado Guitar), deleted app again because I suspected ample data usage. Downloaded app again because I wanted to hear the music I paid for, but I deleted the app again: it devours my data! Feel cheated, but that's how it goes."
"May 30, 2017","This is excellent. I love Amazon music. I love that all my favorite music is available to me"
"May 23, 2016","Amazon Music is awesome and easy to use. I encourage anyone that reads this to get Prime....you will not regret this awesome feature.  Herman"
"December 3, 2015","Best music option for phones and tablets. Upload your own music and playlists or select music and playlists and stations from thousands of artists. Just another great perk to being a Prime member."
"March 28, 2014","It works but the sound quality coming from a phone isn't that great. I guess I would use music on my phone in the car if driving through an area where radio reception isn't so good. Seems easier to just turn on the car radio or play a CD. I know people listen to music on their phones wearing headphones while jogging, commuting etc."
"November 20, 2015","Only listened to a couple of albums and I have to say ""I'm impressed that it is packaged with Amazon prime."" I don't have to wait for the songs I want to hear. This is very important to me."
"December 16, 2014","I honestly don't know why anyone would go with itunes when this is available. I love this service. I use it instead of Pandora or itunes. It has a history of every single CD I have ever purchased in the history of buying from Amazon. It was automatically downloaded for free."
"October 19, 2014","The Mac version of Amazon Music Player is garbage, pure and simple. I can't speak for the Windows version, but the Mac version frequently (read: almost always) hangs for LONG periods of time before showing tracks in any section of the player. It also appears to use a lot of resources - I see system-wide issues while using Music Player, but when I completely close out of it, OS X goes back to behaving like it should. Now that we're forced to use this player to download any music we've added to Amazon Music, I've gone from merely irritated to absolutely angry. It is AWFUL software, and after several years dealing with quirks and outright problems with Amazon Music, I really wonder if Amazon will EVER get this working correctly.  Other ""fun"" issues:  Badly matched songs (completely the wrong recordings - we're talking live songs being replaced by studio versions!) You can attempt to correct the match, but I have yet to get this to work well.  MISSING songs! Inexplicably, some songs are just GONE from my library. Totally random - most albums are fine, others are missing this or that song, or maybe a couple. Infuriating.  Tag editor destroys existing ID3 tags: if you dare edit any info in the file(s) you've uploaded, you will be rewarded with a downloadable version that has completely stripped out ALL tags. You won't know what song is what. ALL tags are empty, so there will be no artist to go by, no track name, no track number, no album name. NOTHING. This sounds completely unacceptable were it not for the need to rarely do this, but what makes it truly completely unacceptable is the fact that tracks in your library may randomly have their ID3 tags altered by either the uploader, whatever software runs on Amazon's servers, or the Music Player. And you're screwed at that point.  Other than that, it's GREAT."
"June 16, 2016","Best album by them yet"
"September 13, 2015","Havent fully explored everything it has to offer but, so far i am very happy to have purchased Prime on Amazon. Plus there is so much more with the Prime membership it's well worth tha cost.. Very happy customer !!!"
"April 10, 2016","Can't play prime music on my fire tablet !"
"December 11, 2016","Like the concept but Amazon Music does not explain how to use it ---- frustrating as its by chance you learn"
"May 18, 2015","I liked the idea of this app....but something feels kinda unstable about it. It always crashes and suddenly closes when I try to use it on my Samsung Android phone. It is quite annoying to be listening to music and it suddenly stops mid song."
"June 19, 2016","Meets my satisfaction"
"October 29, 2015","So nice to pick the movies you love!"
"June 18, 2016","Great music selection"
"August 1, 2015","Great app, but way too limited in its music collection when you compare it to Google Play. I hope the library grows."
"March 28, 2016","In addition to other bugs, I cannot remove this and now it keeps trying to update, but that fails. Amazon chose poorly when the hired the developers for this. Shameful."
"October 15, 2015","Absolutely love this benefit to my amazon prime account. Great choices of music, and very customizable. I love that I can create my own play list too. No interruptions during the songs which is a major plus!"
"December 1, 2013","Great app. The UI is excellently designed and well thought out. Store, Library and Player navigation in excellent. I would give it a perfect 5/5 stars but for one fundamental flaw. Why the heck should I have to submit my credit card details when I'm already logged into my Amazon account. All my payment details are already saved on my account, aren't they?"
"January 14, 2015","The old Amazon MP3 always worked - and was usually my de facto music player on my phone. It was replaced with this slow, unweildy monstrosity that almost always crashes."
"April 6, 2016","All sorts of problems getting this to work."
"June 7, 2016","great selection of music"
"April 9, 2015","Make an option to exit the app. Put more selection into the Prime eligible music, there has to be a better way to search for music without having NOW and KIDZBOP being every other item on the list. Add more filters to make searching for music easier."
"April 12, 2015","Amazon what did you do this new update is horrible. You took functions away and made it hard to navigate. If it's not broke don't fix it! I can't fast forward my music anymore and trying to find recent downloads is next to impossible. Plus the bugs."
"October 12, 2015","Workd great. If I look my kindle battery or don't want to carry it along with the other 325 pounds of stuff in my purse. Have a back-up, plus can play what I want to listen to while I'm driving. Thank you!"
"November 6, 2016","I love having my songs on my phone where I can listen to them without the Internet. It's great quality sounds."
"February 15, 2016","This is great. Much better than google play's music feature and the android app is quite good as well. This was actually one of the things that made me want to get Amazon prime."
"January 28, 2016","Wonderful to access my music on my laptop, tablet and Fire, and when I purchase and download tracks and songs, they are automatically transmitted into my music library on all three."
"July 21, 2015","Absolutely love it! I take advantage of Prime shipping and Prime video but hadn't used the music and really love it!!"
"October 17, 2017","I find just about everything I am looking for and then some. Great business."
"May 26, 2017","I love this music app!"
"February 9, 2016","I was under the impression I could download about any song I could think of but I've come across a few that I would have to pay to download. I thought the annual fee covered that"
"June 30, 2016","this is a great way to listen to music you like without having to purchase it separately. But easily you can purchase albums or singles from it."
"May 4, 2017","LUV IT!! AWSOME WITH PRIME. STOKED TO GET TO LISTEN TO WHOLE ALBUMS WITHOUT COMMERCIALS!!!"
"September 26, 2015","such a great app"
"December 12, 2014","works great would like to figure out how to store music offline"
"May 31, 2017","It's functionality is nice. I like that I can choose ""Offline Music"" and just listen to my own songs rather than streaming randomly from some online stream. However, in my experience thus far, the sound processing and regeneration through my bluetooth connection (to my car stereo) is lacking. The full range of the music doesn't seem to be getting through -- almost as if it thinks I'm playing to headphones and so it's cutting back on the bass a bit. I've found some (not many!) music players that will allow me to pause the music from my stereo. Maybe its my stereo's fault, but I can't do that with the Amazon Music App. It also doesn't show the time tracking of the track that's playing, where some players seem to be able to do that just fine. It would also be nice if they'd get on board with the ""Google Assistant"" programming and make it so I can tell ""OK Google"" to run certain commands within the app."
"February 8, 2016","Great selection of recommended music. It's like Amazon Music gets me!"
"February 16, 2016","It's got a good amount of popular songs, and bands on here. It not near Spotify variety, but for casual listening if you alredy have Prime it's definitely an app worth getting."
"February 2, 2017","Good selection of music with great quality, all included with my Prime subscription, what's not to like?"
"August 19, 2016","LOVE my Amazon Music through Prime - actually it's one of the main reasons I stay with my Prime membership (other than the shipping)."
"December 7, 2016","Music selections are always changing, so your selections may not be there when you go back later to listen!"
"June 16, 2016","Very good music site"
"July 15, 2016","Great application, but I wish there was a way to integrate the music on my phone's physical memory with the songs I have in my Prime library."
"September 3, 2016","Love the variety of music and the ability to skip as many songs I want. You are able to put music in your library for ease of listening later."
"May 12, 2016","I love it. The only issue is when my phone goes on sleep mode or screen saver it shuts off the music. No clue how to fix that issue. Otherwise I love it;)"
"March 2, 2016","This is almost perfect, just add a way to search prime music by genre, and a way to share a suggested album or song with prime friends and family. Then you'll have a 5 star"
"November 23, 2016","Easy to install and use. Bit limited on range and choice compared to Spotify and Deezer but good value overall"
"June 25, 2016","Awesome as always"
"June 28, 2016","Awesome stations"
"September 10, 2015","I've been using Amazon music for years and I've never had any issues with it. I love how much free music I get and it's always exactly the music I want, rather than random suggestions just ending up in my library."
"December 17, 2016","Amazon music is wonderful. There is a great selection and it is very easy to use, download and transfer."
"June 28, 2016","Good stuff here!"
"May 11, 2017","Very user friendly. Just got prime and started using music. So good so far."
"September 21, 2017","great music on my laptop and phone"
"August 15, 2014","for prime customers this is an awesome venue."
"June 10, 2017","JUST START LISTENING TO IT TODAY AND HAVING THE BEST TIME LISTENING TO OLD AND NEW MUSIC."
"December 3, 2015","There is a great selection of music and also Prime music. Big problem with skips during playback of downloads. If the skips were not there, the player would be comparable with my Wife's iphone."
"June 20, 2016","GREAT APP W/NO ADS"
"December 12, 2016","Work good, great tunes, the only problem I have is I can't stop it playing without powering down my unit."
"June 7, 2016","Small library of music"
"July 12, 2016","Good selection of music. Rivals Pandora and other streaming services because NO ADS. You're already paying for Prime- take advantage of this!"
"June 16, 2013","The app is easy to use, both for Android and PC. My only gripe -- and it's less about the app than the songs that can't be saved to the cloud -- is that when I purchase a CD on Amazon, only some of the songs transfer to the cloud. In some cases, very few of the songs. I'm guessing this is a copyright issue, but it is disappointing nonetheless. If not for that, I'd give the app 5 stars."
"January 14, 2017","Awesome, to have this much music @ your fingertip or with your voice. Customerservice is the very best."
"January 30, 2017","The only complaint I would have is that there could be more songs, but that is strictly my being cheap."
"September 5, 2017","love it!"
"November 10, 2015","Limited bollywood songs. But the quality of songs is good. On comparing with other competitors, we need options like mirroring to other device through airplay or casting such as Logitech, chrome."
"August 9, 2015","Awesome"
"June 17, 2014","I don't think amazon knows yet. Selection is weak. Queuing up a play list is clunky and not intuitive. Get back to me when you guys figure it out as I have Pandora and Spotify and don't have to pay $100/yr to get access."
"May 7, 2016","Its perfect, you can listen to one specific song or make your own playlist unlike pandora. Theres no ads and it has the lyrics for all the songs. I love it."
"July 5, 2016","I love it!!!! Best music app I've ever had!!!! Becoming a prime member is the best choice I've made online. Ibwish I would've done it sooner."
"July 14, 2015","I love, love, love, love, love Amazon Prime and the mobile app! I started the free trial thinking I would just give it a shot and wound up telling Amazon to definitely just charge me and continue the membership within hours! I cancelled other services that provided similat things and went from spending about $30 per month to just th $100 a year. The mobile music app is the best one I've ever had. Just this alone is worth the money. It is ridiculously user friendly. I actually crashed my phone within a couple of days because I couldn't stop myself and overfilled my memory. No worries though, dumped the entire song collection and what do you know? The entire thing was still in my cloud library. Didn't have to do a single thing but open up her back up and watch all the musical geniuses roll in. I give this app 10 stars out of 5. Way more than I expected for the money."
"July 18, 2016","Excellent App. Its runs very smoothly on my Galaxy S6+. I love the vast available songs variety and accurate suggestions based on my taste."
"July 8, 2017","Good, but skips with bluetooth on"
"March 4, 2016","I'm new to Amazon Prime Music App. I use it for my workouts that I've just started. I've found music from all genres and decades, for me its a hit so far so good.5stars*."
"March 30, 2015","I love Amazon Music Prime. No more losing older downloads or wondering why or where my latest purchases are. The sound quality is excellent even on my phone. I can store as much music as I want and find music I can't find on other services. Love it."
"June 28, 2015","Dropped my Spotify account after realizing it cost more than Amazon Prime--which gives me way more! A few of my Spotify albums are not on Amazon yet, but I don't miss them, especially since this is free with my Prime membership."
"March 4, 2016","I found this app a month or so ago and now use it everywhere I go, every day!! If I'm not streaming your music, I can play my own through the app. LOVE THIS AMAZING AP!!!"
"July 22, 2015","There are a lot of artists I can't get, otherwise it's great!"
"October 17, 2016","This app is important to me in many ways. It great when I am stress and then I go work out . It has music it current."
"January 11, 2017","Really annoying that the music does not stop playing when I get out of my car (Bluetooth disconnects)."
"March 29, 2016","App is OK, however, can't listen to a song before purchasing it. No, ""try it before you buy it"" option, so I ended up purchasing a song I didn't want. :-("
"May 9, 2016","Prime music is awesome! Love the variety of songs by genre. I can listen all day and not hear a song repeated. Great to be able to save songs to my library"
"February 9, 2015","What a great way ro listen to new music using your prime account. You can make multiple playlists thar are right for any of your moods. I have discovered some great tracks and artists in the libraries. Try this one, and see if you like it as much as I do!"
"July 15, 2016","Love that i can listen to music any where I am at on my cell phone. Can even sit outside and listen with out having to take a radio outside"
"June 6, 2016","I can't find no flaws"
"March 3, 2016","Good app. Nice way to listen to your favorite music, especially the music not being played on the radio now. Still learning how to navigate the app but seems easy enough."
"October 15, 2015","Amazon music is the best. It is simple, and all the songs I want are there and easy to put into my playlist. And they are free as long as I don't want to download them. I recommend it to all my friends."
"April 21, 2016","I really like the download function. I haven't figured out how to organize the songs very well yet. The Music quality is good and album covers are beautiful."
"October 13, 2011","This is an excellent music player, and does well whether it is feeding from the cloud or from your local device. It could use the ability to backup an on-device playlist to the cloud, and download a cloud playlist to the phone or tablet, resolving it to music already on the device. It's a real problem when you create a playlist of songs, and if the device goes through a major reset of some kind that clears the media database, then the playlist is lost forever and needs to be recreated."
"May 28, 2017","I love this app! I can basically put in any song and they have it."
"December 1, 2016","Some of the music I listen to isn't there but overall a great music service that I can listen to anywhere."
"June 21, 2016","I love this app!"
"March 4, 2016","Not as much music as I had hoped,at least not what I listen to. It's OK. But I more than likely won't be keeping prime . After this year I will be cancelling. Lori"
"June 7, 2016","Great functionality."
"June 20, 2016","Enjoying the app"
"February 16, 2017","been listening to lots of my favourite music using this app. I got is for Free as a Prime Member"
"May 17, 2016","Honestly not that bad. Now I can't find some of the song because I refuse to buy music for 1.29 but every store is like that but quite frankly I love it"
"July 10, 2017","Great music, but they do drop a lot of albums"
"May 29, 2017","A plus"
"September 7, 2015","I had Amazon Prime before I really took advantage of all it has to offer, and now I can't live without it. They have a fantastic selection of Christian and Worship music which has been hard to find in one place!"
"July 21, 2013","I love having the MP3 app from Amazon. I've got it on my phone & my tablet. So I have my music on 2 devices plus my kiddo's tablet :0) I've got access set up for everyone to use. It's easy too use and making play list for all makes it easy for all too use. It's free so how could anyone say no? And, there is lots of great deals on music. :0) how do I put it on our laptop?? lol"
"November 14, 2014","After repeated tries on my OnePlus One, Amazon Music always crashes when trying to open. It's a good thing I have Google All Access. I also cannot see this app in the Google Play Store anymore, which indicates that they could have dropped support for this phone. Disappointed."
"April 10, 2015","The upside of this app is that you can find virtually any song you suddenly have an urge to hear, and with Prime you can do it at no extra cost.  The UI has gotten much better over the last year. It looks the same but it's much more responsive."
"June 25, 2016","Love love love"
"October 31, 2014","I do not like that I can not put my music on my SD card. What the heck! Also what is the deal with apps now? They think they need access to everything in your device! I don't think so! For this reason I Uninstalled the app. NO ONE BUT ME NEEDS ACCESS TO MY CALLS AND MY SD CARD!"
"March 1, 2016","The music selection is fine and quality great... However it is difficult to turn off. The only was is to log out or clear cache. Stopping music should be more intuitive."
"August 31, 2015","Only down fall I couldn't get it to work with my Smart TV ....I just purchased my TV this year....can't find or download the App. Would be nice to play my own Music instead of the MILK Music all the time !!!!! :("
"June 28, 2016","don't use it"
"June 11, 2016","I can get my music"
"August 28, 2017","I like you can download the music so you can play it even when you don't have service."
"June 7, 2017","App tells me install is pending, but will not start downloading, no matter what I try."
"June 14, 2016","Love Amazon Music"
"September 8, 2015","Wonderful music on Prime with so much to choose from, lesser known to top stars. I love finding oldies, and newly discovered music on Prime. And of course it all comes with my Prime membership. Best deal going!"
"June 27, 2016","It's awesome!"
"July 21, 2017","For the majority of the songs l want l have to pay extra,and it doesn't work right half of the time."
"December 23, 2016","Very nice app, easy and convenient to access amazon music. Get in Play Store and definitely 5 stars."
"July 17, 2017","This is great Love it with my echo show"
"November 7, 2016","I love the variety and ease of use!! I especially love you can listen to whole albums; it's very customizable."
"July 31, 2016","Decent choice of songs but the catalog is by no means exhaustive. Still, as a free service with my prime membership I can't complain."
"February 20, 2015","It's ok, but only for the one person in the household who registered prime to their email address. Also, the biggest negative for me is that its not compatible with Sonos which I'm invested in at my home."
"April 6, 2016","The navigation of this app is a joke!"
"June 21, 2016","I just love it"
"June 27, 2016","Love love it"
"February 9, 2015","Works great with my laptop. Little confusing to figure out at first. Does not work with my galaxy 4. Keeps saying I need to change device language to a select group of languages. My phone is set to English which is on of the choices. Please fix this issue"
"July 24, 2016","I love having my music at my finger tips along with millions of other songs. My favorite is the stations, what ever my mood it is met."
"June 10, 2016","It's like Itunes."
"April 22, 2016","I like everything about it but the selectoin. There are several bands i listen to that i search and come up empty. There needs to be a bigger metal library."
"February 5, 2015","works great"
"April 26, 2016","this has a great selection of good tunes with prime members but it is confusing navigating through site they could if amazon wanted to streamline this app"
"February 1, 2017","Great app, but getting sick of being asked to pay more for the music when I'm already paying for it"
"February 5, 2017","I wish there were some more newer releases but this platform is such a plus to being a prime member"
"December 11, 2016","My son and I love Amazon music!! Always something to listen to! Don't have to deal with commercials!!"
"June 2, 2017","Easy to use and a great selection of music."
"June 13, 2016","Love PRIME MUSIC"
"July 19, 2016","It seems to buffer alot. Sometimes it will just quit working. I have 10 gb of high speed data on my cell phone and still have problems."
"August 7, 2017","Love"
"October 29, 2017","Good"
"August 9, 2016","Anyone thinking of purchasing Amazon Music Prime should; point blank. I fully enjoy the rich experience provided by Amazon Prime."
"September 30, 2013","This is the easiedt way to play all your music on all your devices. I tried every app to get my itune library on my android phone and this was the bedt solution."
"May 12, 2013","Don't mark this app down because your phone is crap. The size is tiny if you have a modern phone. It does not waste CPU and doesnt even use much resources when you ARE using it. The selection is awesome, there are many deals on albums. Thanks to the convenience of this app and deals on albums, I have eliminated my pirated songs. Now just need Amazon VOD for Android. I love Amazon!"
"June 25, 2016","It's great😀"
"February 4, 2016","Received a free digital copy of a CD I bought. I uploaded a couple more CDs I own and now I have access to some of my music while I am at work. It's a great, free feature!"
"November 10, 2017","Love it so much. However, it's so much more complete with unlimited..."
"April 10, 2016","Library is huge, with anything I've ever looked for being available. Although, not all free. But the Free selection (with Amazon Prime) is also quite large!"
"July 18, 2017","Like that it comes with prime and I can have it anywhere I have prime."
"July 23, 2017","Not a fan of most music platforms. This is pretty good."
"May 1, 2017","I enjoy the app."
"May 30, 2017","Very good music."
"August 12, 2017","Great Music many choices !!!!"
"June 4, 2016","LOVE LOVE LOVE it!"
"February 7, 2016","No issues with this app. Seems to work fine and is fairly intuitive. No negative impacts on phone performance that I have noticed YET. Hope it will continue to work nicely!"
"June 7, 2016","Got what I needed"
"January 23, 2017","Im a little unsure of how to use it. Definitely a learning curve. BTW how do you make it turn off?"
"October 19, 2015","What other people say I really don't care I L♡VE IT!!!esp. Tones of free download music like Surprisingly STEVE AOKI's New album <--------all free downloaded I'm loving Amazon Music (with Prime)"
"March 23, 2016","Library is extremely small. Too small for my undergound/indie/eclectic taste in music. Too many more options out there that provide a vastly wider array of music"
"June 16, 2016","Very satisfied"
"May 21, 2014","It plays music. It; however, does not play my ""entire library"". It only shows music from the cloud. I have a lot of music and quite a bit was purchased in the 90s/00s, some from Amazon and other places. My ripped tracks do not show. Very disappointed the app is dumber than a music player."
"November 3, 2014","Favorite place to download music the app is simple to find and download music. Have no problems with moving music to my SD card never had any problem and no need to download a app to move the music just got into you folders and move it. The only place I use to get music now."
"May 7, 2016","I uninstalled, wanted to buy digital music and download to my Android, since thi spp is imposed, I am looking to move away from buying songs in Amazon."
"June 2, 2016","Seems to work well"
"June 18, 2015","It doesn't work. It crashes as soon as I open it and will only play music that is already on my phone."
"March 26, 2015","It took awhile for me to realize that this service was part of Prime. Now that I've been using it for awhile, I feel like a fool for not having used it before! Sure, not every artist is available to stream, but many hours of music are available. The ability to add songs to your library, make play lists and sort by artist, song or genre make this a very usable way to enjoy music. I still listen to Pandora and have found a lot of new music that way. But there is nothing like being able to punch up that perfect song for whatever mood your in, assuming of course it's available..."
"September 15, 2016","I'm enjoying the selections of varieties of music. All at the disposal of my choice. I'M GETTING MY MONEY WORTHS!!!!!!!"
"September 4, 2015","Tried several times to download this app. Whenever I have tried to download and play a song I never hear the song but the app slowly drains memory from the tablet and almost makes it impossible le to reboot."
"January 29, 2013","I have moved all my music to Amazon Cloud Player, as Google Music was limiting and iTunes Match was a joke for me. Really l ike the service. But Amazon has invested so much, seems like they would invest in a more robust app for their music. But it is a simple easy to use app. Play back is good, but not excellent, has so much potential."
"May 24, 2017","Love Amazon music! All of my favorites to get me through the workday!"
"May 31, 2017","I love this app. I am able to listen to songs no other music app has."
"December 23, 2015","The best music application that I have had!! The selection of music is great and because of this I have now cancelled my Pandora subscription and Google music!! Couldn't be happier!!"
"May 14, 2017","Great program ."
"June 15, 2017","awesome beats pandora by far"
"August 1, 2014","Just installed this yesterday so I don't have much experience.  You can create a play list or just display your entire Amazon music collection. I learned accidentally how to select a song that is not immediately next in line - double click (left click) on the song you want to jump to."
"June 27, 2016","Great....."
"January 31, 2017","Love this app. It's definitely better than pandora. Able to tailor stations and create playlists."
"November 9, 2015","If you love music and let to hear it while you complete your task (at the computer). This is for you! No need to buy the music, Prime has a nice free selection of a little of everything!"
"December 28, 2012","I have a lot of Amazon mp3s on hard drive, and have been missing them since my laptop started acting crazy. I wanted to pull them down from the cloud onto my phone but kept putting it off. The app makes it too easy to keep procrastinating. You can download or stream and shop for more music and buy with 1-click. The app functions fine on my HTC Incredible 2, no bugs so far. Recommend it without hesitation."
"August 18, 2014","Great App to take advantage of Amazon Prime Music. Everything is good about it but this App needs some kind of Volume Check. Some songs play nice and loud and then others are bit muted, there is no setting as far as I can tell, where one can make all songs play at the same volume level..."
"February 6, 2015","Very easy to use. I didn't realize music I had bought this past year on DVD was in the cloud on my list of music. Now I have tunes I like on my laptop and phone. Frivolous -- maybe, but I can't carry my stereo with me and I never liked my MP3 player."
"June 12, 2016","Love my music."
"June 22, 2014","When I was told about this opportunity, it didn't faze me until I was shown the range of music to choose from. Pandora was more bothersome but I was able to listen to my favorites with such ease I was amazed. It sent me dancing throughout the house. Thanks I have it on my iPad and Galaxy. Just awesome!"
"December 24, 2015","Constantly skipping during playback regardless If you download or stream..waiting long time for a fix and its done it on 3 phones I owned..NRFPT  Not Ready For Prime Time."
"June 9, 2016","Its the best!!!"
"May 31, 2016","My wife is primary on our amazon prime account and thus my account does not have full access to prime music. Otherwise good little music player."
"February 16, 2016","decent selection of music, streaming is limited. Frustrating (and infuriating) that it's not compatible with Chromecast. Good for road trips if you have the data."
"June 21, 2016","Great songs"
"November 24, 2015","Difficult to locate my purchases using my Android phone from the website."
"June 11, 2016","Great music choices"
"June 14, 2016","It's nice now"
"July 18, 2017","The worst apps I have ever installed , fully garbage ."
"May 14, 2017","Love this app!"
"February 10, 2017","it does not access to all songs by each singer/group, and a limited selection of Dubstep remixes"
"May 21, 2016","I like that there's not commercials. Like pandora you can choose or create your stations and skip songs. It has today's hits which is also nice."
"April 2, 2016","It is great on my computer. It was great on my kindle but since the last update it won't load on my kindle. My kindle is authorized to use it. I have full bars on my WiFi yet it will not load. It will not even load my offline content. It just stay will the line thing that spins around in a circle constantly spinning but nothing in the background but a blank screen with the side possible accessible such as going to your library and things. or is just a blank screen. with no spinning line. If it was working it would be five stars."
"September 12, 2016","Works really well, but I still stick with Spotify. The app is not as intuitive, and I just love the Spotify run feature"
"December 2, 2015","Great variety"
"July 22, 2016","I like the wide range of choices available. When I listen to the same station a lot I tend to hear repeats, which is why I don't ""love it""."
"June 14, 2015","I absolutely love this app. It is very useful. I find it has replaced Pandara for me and you have unlimited skips between music. Amazon prime allows you to download many songs/albums for free as long as you have amazon prime."
"July 27, 2016","My Galaxy Note 3 gets hot when running this app. Could just be my phone or model. Everything else seems ok with this app so far."
"June 26, 2016","Great app"
"August 11, 2015","I love the variety and the playlist selections. Gives me another reason NOT to have an iTunes account."
"March 23, 2015","I downloaded this app and it didn't even open. It said I had no Internet connection but I do. I tried uninstalling it and then reinstalling it but nothing worked so I don't even know what the app is like because it didn't even open in the first place."
"January 26, 2016","No longer can I have my children listening to prime too much swearing. There used to be an explicit exception but amazon took it out. I even have to be careful. Thumbs down"
"May 30, 2015","I love this app! I'm a guy that like all kinds of music but have always struggled when downloading music but this app had an option to get playlists from specific genres and that is a great place to start a compilation of music!"
"April 27, 2016","The choices are endless. You can create your own lists by genre. I like Classic Rock, and Country music so if I'm in a County mood I have my favorites."
"June 13, 2014","Amazon Prime Music App doesn't work on my Daughter's Nextbook Googleplay Android 4 Tablet. Also the playlist won't load on our Roku box either of Amazon Prime music through the Amazon Cloud App for Roku. Please fix!"
"September 23, 2016","It's great, offers a large selection of music and pre-made playlists make it easy to find music that fits your mood."
"August 1, 2015","Consistently restarts (20 times in one hour) which causes my phone to run slow. Can't set the app to run when you want it to, which is a poor design. A nice way to get the music you want, but until they fix the app it's uninstalled for now."
"June 18, 2016","Great app!!"
"August 25, 2015","My fave music app. The Prime Stations have the best selection of music under each category. Usually you will get one or two great songs but these stations are awesome. Great feature of my Prime membership."
"June 21, 2016","I love it!"
"May 29, 2017","Good music new music any type of song u are looking for it has it on Amazon music"
"June 14, 2017","This App is excellent to play music anywhere anytime."
"June 2, 2015","I'm really enjoying Amazon Prime. The 2 day shipping is awesome! I love the streaming music and the fact you can download and listen while offline. The music library is good, though there are some titles that are not available."
"June 24, 2016","Good job."
"June 27, 2016","Love it!"
"June 17, 2016","It was okay"
"September 24, 2017","Very cool.application and fast streaming, just sometimes it log me our while listening to music"
"August 29, 2017","Hate that this app is not part of the Prime subscription & it has its own separate monthly fee."
"June 26, 2016","Love it❤"
"June 12, 2014","Apple look out. I love this app and find no use for my iPod anymore why would I ? I still believe in buying CD's, I like to read the liner notes and have a tangible item, not just be forced to download it from iTunes. My whole iTunes library is all of my CD's apple iCloud won't let me back up my CD's only music I buy from them and I refuse to conform or be forced by Apple to do so it is so wrong and a big business mistake for them. I believe and support buying cd's not digital downloads.  Finally a very smart solution. A genius move on Amazon's part I downloaded this app, upgraded for $24.99 a year for 250,000 songs and another application that moved my music from iTunes in minutes. I have 3 - samsung note 3 and a galaxy 5, a kindle and a samsung tab it uploaded all my cd's from iTunes in minutes (I have comcast). I put my phone in a holster, in the car and play through the built in blue tooth or can just listen anywhere I go. Another thing Amazon does is when you buy a cd from them they automatically upload it. I am glad to see they are helping to keep music cd's alive and not just offer some digital download, all though they offer both digital and hard copies of cd's I think they are just so ahead of the game and if people were educated caught on, this would topple iPod sales. You don't even need to have one anymore this app makes it all seem like it was a big waste of money and the only game in town, now it collects dust in the drawer. My anger at iCloud not allowing my cd's drove me away. Don't get me wrong I work on a MAC but for music Amazon is the MAC DADDY.  Kudos to Amazon such a fine genius job. So sick of Apple and every time the computer crashed I lost all my cd's in iTunes because iCloud would not allow me to save my own cd's and had to start all over again. Amazon has is and always will be extremely advanced. Dropbox, iCloud have nothing on this app. It is clunky once and a while and slow but for the most part streams seamlessly. Also great on my Kindle HDX and all my other devices way to go Amazon !"
"September 13, 2015","Easiest music application I've ever downloaded. You can download songs, albums or play stations with your favorite artists! I wish there was newer music in here but the choices available are really good!"
"May 8, 2015","Semi-clunky interface. Realize that use of this app means being tied to your smartphone/similar. Amazon doesn't want to become a Pandora and allow streaming through certain electronic equipment. Until then I'll remain a non-user."
"June 25, 2016","Love it."
"September 24, 2016","A better app than most but only wish that it had an wake up alarm and that it had more control for my android auto."
"June 5, 2016","love this app!"
"October 5, 2016","Prime music is the best. All purchases are in the cloud and I can download instead having to wait for shipping."
"May 17, 2014","Works great on my Samsung Galaxy S4 if my device is set to English.  When my device is set to Spanish, this so won't open. Instead I am given a list of languages from which I must set my device. One of my choices is Español (España), but my phone only let's me choose español."
"June 24, 2016","Love it."
"January 28, 2014","I got this app because it allows me to import my music to my android for use with a ringtone converter. (I can't upload with USB because I can't find a compatible data cable.) The bonus is that it plays my music loud enough to actually hear without headphones. The only downside is that the free app is limited to only 250 songs."
"March 28, 2013","I love to use this app on my Galaxy nexus, but it has a terrible problem of randomly stopping while playing music. I'm pretty sure it isn't some specific notification that stops the player, it's just random. Then you have to turn on your phone, unlock, and hit play manually to restart. Big problem, but otherwise great app."
"April 5, 2016","I like Google play music better."
"June 20, 2016","Love love"
"March 2, 2016","This is a very cool service, but I don't have that much time to listen to music anymore. But it's an Amazon Prime product, so you know it's gonna be great anyway."
"December 17, 2014","Another great benefit of being an Amazon Prime member, usd99 annually. With this app, I can get my Prime music on my android tablet. (Edit=>) For security purposes, later versions of android were modified to prevent apps from writing easily to the add-on SD card. But each app can create ONE folder on the add-on card to write to. Amazon Music apparently hasn't chosen to do so.  But that's not a problem since you can connect your android tablet/phone to your PC using a USB cord (you can use the one for charging). With your Windows PC and android device on (signed on to both), both the internal and external storage for your device will appear either as folders, or as new drives. This allows you to read, write, move all your files from one storage area to another or to/from your PC. I think you should change your device time to lock to give you enough time to accomplish your business when you are moving files around using this method. Change it back when you are done.  Meanwhile, there is an app named ""Amazon MP3 Mover"" that will move any amazon mp3 music you buy to the add-on SD card, to the app's assigned folder.  [On copying my music from my PC to a folder [Music] I created on my add-on card, error messages would periodically appear. Some were that there was no license for music that required a license. Some were that the format was not recognized. Just hit ""skip"".]"
"June 23, 2016","Love it."
"October 22, 2015","I was 2 days out of warranty on 2 of my android devices, I messed up and did not get to the post office in time. I at leased thought they should be covered for a year as is most stuff. You suck"
"May 14, 2015","Telling me I can't stream for 12 days?"
"June 2, 2017","Very good product. Very user friendly"
"March 29, 2015","This is one of the best examples of why software should work flawlessly, but the team behind amazon music makes sure it doesn't. It takes up enough memory to run a small virtual machine, the download queue often hangs with more than two albums in it, and today I had to uninstall the app and lose all the music I downloaded because two albums were stuck in limbo downloading. They were stored on my device fine, but the app day restarting every 5 minutes to download these two albums. I've always installed from the play store, let's see if you put a different version on your app store. I finally got a premium PHONE, LG G3, that just might run amazon prime music, but it's just that deplorable of programming. Please revamp the app, compared to the rest of Amazon this is atrocious."
"June 16, 2016","Good music"
"June 8, 2015","Great app. The only reason I give 4 stars is because it won't transfer all of your music in your library. I cracked my screen on my phone and had to get a replacement... was disappointed when all of my music didn't transfer."
"November 23, 2016","This is my goal to app for listening to my music. Easy to download music for offline listening."
"December 6, 2014","I just wish the damned thing would work consistently. I thought it was purely a lack of support for the One Plus One, but it doesn't work correctly on either of my previous Nexus phones. My Library is hamstrung in an ecosystem that I can't take with me on the go."
"January 7, 2015","The Amazon prime music is great, I love the amount of free music available and the ability to download to device. But wtf is the deal with not allowing downloaded data to be stored on external sd? Fills up device storage quickly! Amazon should be providing better service rather than trying to be like Apple."
"June 17, 2014","Loaded it on my android phone an removed ten minutes later. Let me know when there are options available other than POP. I even looked at the Latin selections, looked pretty miserable. Pandora has it right!"
"December 29, 2014","The interface is lacking, and the whole &#34;cloud or device&#34; thing is confusing. The navigation around the app shouldn't just default to albums. And it won't read any audio from an SD card, so if I put a bunch of music on a card it is invisible."
"June 25, 2016","Love it"
"April 12, 2017","I have amazon prime and its great but they want you to pay more $$ for the unlimited music to get everything. My son cant get his fav songs bc Im not paying any more $ so he still uses Spotify."
"May 29, 2017","It's a very good service. It plays good selections."
"July 19, 2017","great selection of music"
"June 14, 2016","Thank You!"
"March 16, 2017","After a lot of back-and-forth escalating to a manager in the tech area, finally Amazon said they specifically stopped supporting Blackberry Android systems."
"August 6, 2015","I couldn't figure out how to use the website or order any music. My account said I had $15 free balance, but I don't know how to use it. Can I order a free album? How? Where? From pegstreasure@gmail.com"
"June 10, 2016","It was good"
"June 13, 2016","fantastick"
"November 12, 2015","Really could use a car mode. If you have your phone mounted the buttons for forward/reverse and thumbs up/down are too small sometimes it takes two or three times to hit the button right."
"June 25, 2016","This to be ordered"
"August 20, 2013","If you are not a tech, it hard to use the cloud and sinc of your play list to the Kindle. Instructions are over the top and hard to get your arms around it. The younger generation has had IPOD forever and it is a no brainer but me being a baby boomer, it take a little more information and asking questions to several other people to get it all working right!"
"June 25, 2015","nice app"
"June 6, 2016","Works great."
"June 16, 2016","It was ok"
"June 6, 2016","Awesome app!"
"June 16, 2016","I like it"
"February 17, 2016","Music variety is not vast enough. Amazon has deleted some of my music files because it is no longer featured. Then there is music that they just do not have at all."
"October 28, 2016","""unlimited"" Listening now, helps my work day swim by, Amazon keep the ideas coming, I'm on board."
"December 23, 2015","Prime music works on my phone but not my Samsung galaxy pro tablet. Have tried reinstalling multiple times and it still doesn't work. Would rate 4 if it worked on both devices."
"June 5, 2016","Love it!!!!!"
"March 1, 2015","It is difficult, sometimes impossible, to manage music files from the app. This makes downloading or deleting Prime Music impossible at moments. Your Prime Music is also saved to your internal storage with no option to put it on SD card which is a huge disadvantage if you have small internal storage  Good luck trying to delete MP3s through the app as it will most likely remove the song from the app but keep the files on your device only to appear again in the app later. The experience with Prime Music would improve drastically if basic file management worked smoothly."
"June 18, 2016","Love it!"
"October 23, 2016","Once you tell it what you like and what you don't it's fantastic. I practically never have to skip a song."
"September 13, 2014","The only thing I like about this app is it makes my music available. Given the large amount of music on my computer it would be almost impossible to have it all on my phone otherwise. They did just recently add a scroll where I can look for songs by their name and actually tell what letter I am near, before it was just a guessing game. The app really works best on WiFi and is spotty otherwise. It does not give me the option to listen to music based upon the genres So I am normally listening to all my music at once and skipping a lot of songs. If I search for an artist it does not let me play all songs with them in it. Additionally if I search for a song I have to play that song continuously or go back to the app and scroll laboriously through my song list. This is why I only use this app if I will be in the car an hour or more. It takes too much time to work it otherwise. So I still am stuck with a limited selection of music that can fit on my phone."
"May 29, 2016","I love this app"
"March 30, 2015","Excellent Selection, Plays without skips in high quality. No timeouts. My opinion is that it's better than Pandora's One (pay version)."
"June 8, 2017","I tried to access my account on my tablet and it would not work."
"March 27, 2015","Love it."
"July 28, 2014","It prompts me that I need to be prime to use it, even though I am already prime user. You need to browse for albums every time you want to add music, you can not add music like with google play when you just move the cursor over the album and right click to add to your library or playlist."
"April 28, 2017","I am unaware that I ordered, or paid for, any music. Please enlighten me."
"August 24, 2015","Love this app...you can not only listen to whatever music you love ,but you can also download a song to your phone or even an artists entire album while listening to that music...and it's endless...woo hoo"
"May 23, 2017","App crashes quite often"
"November 9, 2016","Been using Amazon music for years. Buy all my music from them. And with prime all the better"
"June 15, 2014","Downloaded this app to my Android phone a couple of days ago and then proceeded to add songs to my playlist. I just love the way Amazon made it possible for a person not computer or cell phone literate to download songs for future listening. Now I've got all the ""golden oldies"" on my phone."
"January 2, 2016","This is really frustrating because can't even open the app after successfully installing it. Plus, why can't Amazon consolidate all as under one or two cause it is confusing."
"June 20, 2016","KCCO!!!"
"June 3, 2016","This is good"
"June 3, 2016","I love it!!!"
"March 18, 2016","So far, so good. Love that i can listen to my music when im overseas. Pandora does not have this functionality and since i travel frequently ut comes handy!"
"January 1, 2016","I absolutely love this app my daughter in law got me a new phone for Christmas and I found amazon on line . There isn't enough words that could express my delight in this app"
"July 14, 2014","if it is free why do you keep trying to sell me other programs to make this one work? If customer satisfaction is your goal stop screwing with people and tell the truth up front. You are as bad as goggle."
"June 6, 2016","Lots of fun"
"August 1, 2015","Refuses to sync with new phone among other persistent problems that never seem to get fixes in updates"
"July 9, 2016","It's ok I have Tidal which is way better only because user interface is beautiful and it has playlists which Amazon music does not"
"June 27, 2014","I have used Amazon Music for about a year on my computer and love the ease of use of the program. You might never need another mrdia player. I also like Autorip so I can play the CD I purchased before it comes in the mail. The Android version works as well and allowsthese features on mmy tablet."
"August 21, 2015","This app is great on mobile, but on a computer? Terrible. Terrible enough for me to knock off two stars without hesitation. It won't sync properly and completely ignores music that I've bought in the past."
"June 16, 2014","I tried to find some of my favorite bands. Just like Prime for movies, everything I want costs more $$$. The free stuff doesn't cut it. I'm sticking with free Pandora for now until Amazon expands its collection."
"January 10, 2017","You know, I buy your kindles, I think we're on like 8 or 9 now for the family, we pay for Prime, we rent movies, we bought a Fire and now in your ever gluttonous, ravenous need for greed you now want us to pay seven flipping ninty- five a month for the privilege of what we had for free before. Wow, now maybe FB can start charging me to post messages too."
"July 18, 2016","This is an added bonus with a Prime membership, and as such, it's great!  The selection is a little limited compared to other music streaming services, but that's not a problem for me. They've added new features like radio stations and curated playlists, so I find myself using this app and the web player quite frequently.  The mobile app allows to download songs and playlists for offline listening, so that's a great feature. Though the downloaded songs will not be detected by other media player apps on the device.  It's not pushy in trying to make me buy more music. There are no ads.  I did not find this app for my smart TV and Blu-ray player, so that was disappointing. But some media players like Roku support it, so you could use your home theater to listen to Amazon Music."
"June 25, 2016","Great"
"November 5, 2016","Love the search feature. I use this app several times a week for walking to upbeat music and at work."
"March 26, 2017","I thought I would be disappointed with the variety in the library NOT TRUE!! it was the BOMB!! They had music I haven't heard in 20+ years its awesome one of the many reasons I renewed my subscription to Prime. I had my doubts about the membership & the cost i admit that I didn't have all the facts & the complete scope of the program they were selling. Listen to me take the time to check the whole "" Prime offer "" out before you decline. I wasn't going to buy into the Amazon prime thing at all but as I was against the wall and x-mas was only 2 weeks away ""Free shipping & I got a free 30 day trial membership no strings attached "" when the dust settled & it was over I had the time to use prime I loved it and I will say this use the 30 day trail free with all the benefits free shipping free movies, games plus ""Alexa "" you and your family will wonder how & why you didn't sign up sooner. Enjoy 😊"
"June 24, 2016","Great"
"June 14, 2016","Amazing!"
"December 3, 2016","Never used any music aps before. Has allowed me to date download many songs and listen to them."
"June 14, 2016","Lòve it!"
"January 24, 2016","Okay but doesn't feel very intuitive to use. And it hasn't worked well streaming onto my mobile. It keeps asking me to renew my prime account before it will play songs."
"May 23, 2017","Excellent"
"June 7, 2016","Great deal"
"September 28, 2017","Even though my Samsung Galaxy S7 operates on Android, this app refuses to install. Useless."
"February 9, 2017","Very good desktop ap I can use to listen to my prime music library while at my desk at work"
"December 25, 2016","Love this app so much. Everything is just so easy to use!! So much prime music its awesome!"
"June 7, 2016","Good music"
"December 6, 2016","I have not been able to open or use this app since I downloaded it. Not very happy about that!"
"May 24, 2016","This app has replaced all of my other music apps. I love that I can save some music to my phone and others I can stream without using space."
"June 3, 2016","On time...."
"August 18, 2015","I love this..I can find all the music I want..but...I'm still not completely sure how to use it."
"November 19, 2016","I love this app. I can customize my own Playlist and they make up songs I might like...and I LOVE."
"June 16, 2016","5 stars"
"March 9, 2016","I Hate it because in Mexico you CAN NOT use it do not matter if you pay for the service, this is not good because I can use Spotify perfect in Mexico or USA."
"June 16, 2016","Love it"
"December 14, 2016","Have Music through Prime. Just love it. Easy. Great music. Another quality aspect of Amazon."
"June 9, 2016","Very Good"
"December 9, 2014","Inconsistent, doesn't always work well with my phone (LG on Verizon) and with all my other apps I have no issues. I don't really use it much anymore due to the problems I have with it and their new format to the 'face' of the app and user interface is clunky."
"June 22, 2016","great"
"November 21, 2015","Amazing program Let's you stream or download (online & offline)"
"July 4, 2016","way better than play music. especially since the update where u have to subscribe n its hard to find ur previously purchased music"
"August 10, 2015","Just started using Amazon music. ..so far I like it. Easy to use. Fair variety of music choices."
"June 21, 2016","Good."
"June 15, 2016","awesome"
"June 15, 2016","Love it"
"April 21, 2015","Have not had this app long enough to offer substantial feedback. However, I do not like that t have to enable the feature that allows access from unknown apps. It is setting my system up for undesirable attacks. Fix this please!!!!"
"July 31, 2014","I really don't know if it's OK but I didn't want to give it a bad review. I am unable to use the app on my phone as it has an earlier Android version. Interestingly it seems to install the earlier version of the app not the 'with Prime Music' version. Not usable as intended on my phone."
"December 12, 2015","I like this app overall especially having prime, however; I wish there was more room for uploading additional songs that I already own (ESPECIALLY REMIXES I have a ton of those)"
"November 18, 2016","One of the most comprehensively-designed music apps I've ever used. lots of great features"
"June 26, 2015","It is nice that this is a part of my prime subscription and the selection is fairly decent. It would be nice if there were more/better pre-defined Playlist and stations most are fairly limited from what I have found."
"December 20, 2015","I'm very pleased with the Amazon music site, I can listen to my favorite stars sing the most beautiful music with no commercials. Thank you Amazon Music with Prime Music."
"August 9, 2016","I love it to the max!!! No commercials and way better than that ""P"" app!! Much love for the variety available!!"
"September 25, 2015","Amazing! I've been a Prime member for almost a year and never looked at the perks besides the 2 day shipping. Now I see this and it wonderful! Has all the music I need, and commercial free, too!!"
"August 25, 2016","My only disappointment is that I waited for months to try this out, and then download the app onto my android device."
"July 18, 2017","Really, not falling into your trap"
"March 27, 2015","It is pretty good. Not that much selection with free prime but it is free so I can't complain. I really like Amazon model of one price for a lot of things. It works for me as I use a lot of their services along with my prime membership."
"October 13, 2016","It has all the bands and songs i like and i can listen wherever i want with no commercials like pandora"
"June 3, 2016","I like it."

"September 5, 2016","I've just started using Amazon music with Prime, and so far I like it. Great selection, good sound, easy to use."
"October 27, 2017","I enjoy it very much"
"October 15, 2017","Would not play 90% offline. I've reinstalled about 15 times and the app won't even open."
"November 19, 2014","Will not run on One Plus One CM11 - just crashes in an infinite loop. Any way you look at it - this is a very poorly written app. Maybe you should outsource to Google?"
"May 11, 2015","Great. Thanks"
"August 17, 2014","I pay for Prime membership but don't get to take advantage of the ""free"" prime music on my andriod phone! The only place I can listen to this is if I'm sitting in front of my computer."
"November 7, 2016","I love the music. Plus my employer blocks all other online music sources except Amazon, thank god!"
"December 14, 2016","better than Pandora. Listening to a lot of music I would not hear otherwise. thank you !"
"June 2, 2016","I like it"
"June 19, 2016","Love"
"May 13, 2014","Now I can listen to all my cloud music from my phone, now cutting my grass just became a fun experience. I created play lists shuffled my chioces and away you go. Best part the download was free, and easy to install,and gives me access to the cloud. Great job Amazon, just made my life a little better."
"May 29, 2017","Doesn't work on my windows phone. I know it's not a popular platform but still, this should be an easy ask."
"December 8, 2016","Great app. With new sound bar and bass really great way to enjoy my music on the big screen"
"August 10, 2015","Missing some important artists, and some not included in Prime. Was going to check out the some of the stations this weekend, but started on Crosby, Stills, and Nash station and didn't leave all weekend."
"April 30, 2016","I'd give it more stars if I could actually update the app on Android 6.0. Music selection is good though and streaming doesnt use too much data"
"May 21, 2016","Love this APP, works as advertised and does much much more. Able to find and listen all music with ease, also able to buy, download, etc."
"April 2, 2013","After spending about 10 minutes downloading and installing this app, I discover that I will then need to download anything from the Amazon Cloud that I ever want to play. I thought this would be quick and easy, and instead it was a pain. Perhaps it works great once you download all your music into your phone, but I have an iPod for that purpose with the music already loaded on it."
"May 13, 2017","Very good but missing some good singer and albums as part of their catalog"
"July 20, 2015","The application works very well. Prime music is still growing so a lot of stuff is still not on there."
"June 21, 2016","Wow"
"June 14, 2016","Great"
"June 4, 2016","The best"
"December 3, 2015","I found it hard to navigate. I could not put it in a playlist on my desktop and open the list on my phone. I probably will not use it much. I have my music on my Kindle Fire."
"February 3, 2017","I deleted this and it won't stop crashing my phone every so often, like a rejected ghost"
"January 26, 2017","i listen to focus music on this amazing app every single day! no noise, no ad, just joy!"
"April 20, 2016","It's a great addition to your prime membership and I really like the service. I was actually surprised at the wide selection of available music."
"June 7, 2016","Love it"
"February 2, 2013","I wasn't really big on this app until i realized that all the music i had purchased from Amazon was put on my 'cloud' and I didn't have to do a thing. It really does make purchasing music easier. I can buy the song and once it's in my cloud, I have access to it from whatever device I use - my tablet, my pc, my laptop or my smartphone. MUCH nicer than having to add the music manually to all of those devices."
"May 15, 2015","It's a really awesome selection and it's not hard to search for songs but my problem is I listen through my system in my truck and it is a pain to find what you want to play. It's like they are hidden. But I do like the app"
"March 17, 2016","It lets you have so many variables of genre's .. its Awesome!"
"April 28, 2017","Very satisfied with this service"
"October 15, 2017","love it. Even better with Alexa"
"November 18, 2016","Amazon will not fix SYNC WITH CLOUD ISSUES. I have even given them the firewall logs of my phone to show what servers, ports, times, etc the app is trying to connect to. That way it makes their jobs very simple to troubleshoot by simply looking at an error code on that server. They have had 16 months and can't seem to do a simple task such as that. I am a 17 year Network Engineer and do this kind of stuff day in and day out. My PRIME account is useless but yet I paid over $100 for 16 months now to stream music.....no dice. I want a refund.  I have spent over $2,000 dollars on amazon mp3 music and I can't access any of it. Easily a song a day I buy.....havent bought anything in last 4-6 months due to not being able to access it."
"April 6, 2015","This is such a quick and easy way to find my music! Prime members get a lot of music free, and the charge for the others is very low. I will use this for my primary music storage! If you haven't taken a look at this, I urge you to consider it."
"November 23, 2016","Great selection! I had Google Play Music, but switched to Amazon and am happy with the choice."
"June 14, 2016","U met my exspectations"
"April 17, 2015","Doesn't seem like there is very good connectivity. Stops very quickly when signal strength is low, and does not restart automatically. Started the same station on a different day and it started with same song as before. Pandora seems to be a much more robust service. Wish it was better as I like taking advantage of Amazon Prime services and could see benefits of being connected to Amazon shopping."
"October 22, 2015","Love how the prime playlists are set up already . One playlist called ""Just Beats"" is my favorite, it has lots of music with no lyrics and just smooth beats ! I love it the app."
"February 20, 2015","With Amazon Prime membership you can download music for free. There are awesome songs on here to choose from & I listen to them all them time. The only way it could be better was if they kept adding more music....oh wait, they do! So enjoy!!"
"October 26, 2015","Literally thousands of free hit songs and albums from the Forties to the latest hits! You can listen or sample or buy, making playlists of your favorites as you browse to ears content."
"June 11, 2016","Great"
"July 13, 2015"," "
"August 20, 2016","This app is terrible. I love amazon. I love their music. I buy everything from them and have prime!!! I've bought music from Amazon since they sold only cds... But...this app just stinks. The sound isn't as good as other apps, it doesn't read my other playlists and it got corrupted somehow on my phone. After deleting it and reinstalling this app about 15 times, it finally worked as it used to.. Without my amazon prime music playlists. Badly done, Amazon. Please put some work and pride into your music app!!!"
"June 4, 2016","Love it"
"December 24, 2016","I love that every cd I buy I can hear anywhere...anytime! Love Amazon & their music! 👍"
"December 27, 2016","Love to be able to listen to all different kinds of music without overloading my phone!"
"December 2, 2016","Yes it is excellent if only I could access it from my kindle. Does not work on my kindle!!!"
"August 9, 2016","I am subscribed to this as a benefit of Prime, it is very user friendly and all the music you want at your fingertips!"
"March 29, 2017","This is the best music app!!!!!"
"October 31, 2014","Doesn't come close to the selection convenience or ease of use of an of the other major music subscription services. I was hoping this would push me to resubscribe to prime. But my Netflix and Beats subscription have everything I want from prime and do it better."
"October 28, 2012","Amazon MP3 was the answer to the problem of finding novelty tunes, sound effects, movie themes and science fiction music. I fondly remembered all the novelty tunes of the 1970's which were played regularly on the radio. But how to listen again? I certainly don't want entire albums in some cases. So I picked out the ones I like from Amazon MP3, and viola - back to the fun times. Thank you , Amazon MP3."
"May 18, 2016","Only one complaint. When listening to my mp3s, I can't fast forward or rewind to a selected point. It's back to the beginning or nothing."
"November 9, 2015","Love it, it's background music for my days, no commercials make it great!!! I really like the channels. I pick a channel to suit my mood ant it keeps playing songs I like for hours."
"July 31, 2015","great to have but downloaded a certain album and went to listen to it, it was no longer available"
"April 22, 2016","Love Prime music stations. Variety IS the spice of life and I play different types of music. I love that I can play to whatever mood I'mean in."
"August 23, 2014","great"
"February 6, 2016","Quick and simple to use with a wide variety of music to choose from. And best of all, you can use it anywhere! I love playing Prime Music through my new Echo!"
"May 30, 2015","There is a good selection, but still needs a broader selections by genre . There is a ton of top 40 stations, but no as many other styles, lack of folk, classical, oldies, etc. I am hoping the collections grow with age"
"June 16, 2017","Enjoyed listening to music from my ""younger days""."
"October 4, 2017","Nice way to listen to new music I might not have otherwise"
"February 20, 2015","Is Amazon serious?? An Amazon product incompatible with an amazon app. A laptop gets more attractive every day. VERY disappointed, Amazon."
"July 10, 2015","Love it use it everyday. I am a Amazon Prime member and receive unlimited music to be placed in my library. This alows me to listen to anything in my library offline on my cell phone. FREE is great.....Thanks"
"October 25, 2015","It's good... But far from great, really enjoyed Spotify, but jumped ship with the $65 Prime membership. It'll do for now, will give a better star rating when they're catalogue expands."
"October 17, 2016","Love being able to listen to music on Amazon, but would love more Disney and Christian music options."
"September 6, 2017","excellent variety"
"April 20, 2017","like this program"
"January 27, 2017","It's a overall great app to use for music. Especially the stations you can use for it."
"October 16, 2017","Wont open on my Samsung S6 Active.. What a shame, was so looking forward to it too. 🤔"
"November 2, 2015","Great selection"
"February 21, 2016","Awesome music player. I don't use the stations much, but having the prime music, and the option to download for offline play make long flights a lot better."
"November 15, 2016","Some of the albums are not original, but rerecorded like the band Bad finger for example. Why?"
"January 13, 2013","Love it! Works better than the cloud! And better than the app that came with my Android Phone. More, Please!"
"May 3, 2017","Good selection of classic rock"
"October 28, 2016","its kinda confusing when you are trying to search for music, but i like it and it work pretty good"
"October 2, 2016","Love it! Very satisfied with all the song choices. Found all my favorites from several different genres."
"July 17, 2016","Lots of music that I can pair with Amazon Echo. They both make listening to music easy and enjoyable. I love Amazon music."
"March 30, 2015","Awesome"
"October 22, 2015","When Amazon says if you download the app they give you 25.00 towards purchase of songs, movies, etc. When I go to use that credit, it tells me to update my payment method. It's BOUGUS!"
"June 25, 2014","Maybe it's just me but I don't see how this app does anything but play songs that you already had on your phone and sell new songs to you. I can't find where it streams anything like Pandora or Rhapsody or iTunes. What's the big deal? Why should I use this over the apps I already have?"
"September 12, 2017","Great music app and service both on line and off. Enjoy!"
"August 10, 2016","I use it all the time for mostly nighttime music listening. Great selection and another good perk for Amazon Prime."
"May 24, 2017","Once in and working it is great but sign in and navigation a real pain."
"November 11, 2015","Never seems to work properly downloads same song terrible don't work"
"October 9, 2016","Great app with great sound. Still needs more music in the prime section. But you're doing really well."
"June 4, 2016","Great"
"August 7, 2017","I love that I have music on days there's problems with internet. With no commercials"
"January 19, 2017","Streaming variety and selection has been great. Even better, no annoying commercials!"
"January 27, 2016","Very cool! Even for an old timer."
"December 16, 2014","I'd like nothing more than to keep this app but it's always crashing, and it's so slow that I think I'll save my self the trouble and further dissapointment. The music they have is great and that's why I got the app but it's just not worth it anymore."
"August 25, 2016","Use it all the time. I love using it on road trips especially. Just throw headphones in and give it a startup."
"August 7, 2015","Lost my prime :("
"March 4, 2016","The prime selection could be bigger but let's get real, the ability to listen offline really can't be beat. I don't plan on giving mine up anytime soon."
"July 21, 2016","Rocks!! I heard so many songs I hadn't even thought of in years. Got to enjoy lots of new jams also. Real easy app too."
"November 30, 2016","Great update to the logo as well as the service itself. The interface is much better now!"
"September 19, 2017","Good selection of music, but terrible app. Not worth it"
"September 9, 2016","Potentially the greatest app that I have ever downloaded it. Massive library! Never need to buy music again!"
"June 24, 2014","And I found out that now we have prime music!! I was disappointed that the Prime fee was going up, but now with Prime TV, exclusive HBO AND prime music....it's OK. I'm kind of missing some genres and there's no Marshall Mathers albums but that's OK because they are already in my cloud."
"September 26, 2016","Easy to download, Great to have music so easy to access...Wish there was more choices on artist I like.."
"January 11, 2017","AWESOME TO AUTO RIP MP3 DOWN LOAD IS FREE WHEN YOU BUY A CD WITH MP3 DOWNLOADABLE..."
"December 14, 2014","When you have wifi Its my favorite music app, and just another perk that makes amazon prime great. Seriously hated paying up front but I love it now, pay once get it over with. And use the monthly payment you would have made to save for next year, you will renew. This feature along with all the others makes it worth it. The amount I have saved on shipping alone pays for it. I live in rural northern Minnesota free 2 day, yup and thanks for every other feature. Please dont raise the price again though, I'm still poor :( but the music app is really clean, and does everything pandora does and more. Plus nothing better than test driving a new album, I still usually buy the ones I like. Good art deserves to get paid. Except the drummer from Metallica, I don't even download music and I hate him. Let the new guys bitch, you had 30 years prior to make a living."
"December 6, 2015","Best music app on the market. I can listen to many good Christian songs and even download them on my phone through Wi-Fi to listen to later so I do not have to use my data."
"June 26, 2014","I like it a lot! Has a lot of popular music (I mostly listen to country music so that's what this is based on) and even songs that weren't popular, but that I like. It didn't have a few of the artists that I searched for and that's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. Otherwise, I love it!"
"December 18, 2016","I'm not sure exactly to use is however when I try to find a song it always comes up."
"November 24, 2014","I had to download this app just so I could download ONE SONG to my music player. I don't think I'll be buying music from Amazon again. Amazon rocks for everything I purchase though. And yes, I did uninstall Amazon music shortly after the song downloaded."
"May 29, 2016","YES! Listening has forced into making sure that we are on Wi-Fi because the data usage killed us, but oh how my people love music!"
"September 25, 2015","I understand I have to use this app in order to hear my music, but to start my music I need to first restart my phone. Not sure what's going on there? Other than that everything is fine."
"September 10, 2017","Great variety. Really enjoy several of the playlists."
"December 28, 2015","Comparing to play music....prime has very slow load times, might be Wi-Fi connection. Unable to stream music with my 4g data, I've read that's a limitation prime has."
"July 14, 2016","it works well but it kept trying to charge​ me for songs left and right when listening to a radio station that they have"
"February 13, 2016","Free music included with Prime is awesome! Only down side is that there is no live radio. Would love to get rid of my Sirius / XM and just use Prime Music."
"September 4, 2016","I have been playing lullabies to my new great granddaughter.She is now sound asleep.The lullabies are great."
"May 19, 2016","I love being able to listen to different music genres. I have been able to listen to entire albums before purchasing at my own pace."
"May 19, 2016","I love that on can listen to ""Prime"" music for free and even add it to my library to listen to offline without using my data."
"August 1, 2015","My music at my finger tips there's nothing like it. I download them straight to my MP3 player"
"June 6, 2016",":)"
"August 27, 2015","I like being able to stream whole albums or individual songs on demand. I wish the stations functioned more like Slacker or Pandora, though, and I wish the library of available music was larger."
"October 8, 2015","We love Prime Music. It has replaced other music streaming services in our home. We gave it 4 stars because not all of our favorite artists are available (ie. Red Hot Chili Peppers)."
"March 2, 2016","It's stupid because you have to be connected to the Internet. When I buy music, I don't want to pay for it twice by using my data. Let me download it."
"May 16, 2016","Listen every day"
"March 1, 2013","This wonderful is app is very effective and wonderful resource that I would recommend dnot using on a daily basis. This one many users as myself use day after day and while contine to use daya after day. Definitely not using it would be a trgedy;however, if you use will find it to be a wonderful tool. definitely add to to your phone or tablet or ipad if can be a very useful tool"
"July 19, 2017","I am a Prime member but I can't use it outside of US !"
"April 8, 2015","I would change this rating if I could play my Prime music from my sd card. I have allot of memory available but can't even use it. Even if I manually move the Prime downloads to my sd card. The music choice itself is awesome."
"August 2, 2015","A good experience to have all that music in your back pocket. Seriously, I'm hooked. Beware!"
"October 1, 2014","This app would not work on my RAZR... However, it works as intended (which is not to say smoothly) on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. My opinion has greatly improved since upgrading, but there is still a ballroom left for improvement...  THE GOOD: *Prime Music - ""Free"" with Prime, I didn't have that feature when I subscribed, so it's a plus. I've found around 10 albums on Prime that I didn't already have, so I can listen for ""Free"" and see if I want to buy them permanently. *I can organize my Prime music into playlists on my desktop and listen to them on my phone. *Download for listening offline is great. Connect when on WiFi and I can still listen on the road without using data, perfect! Better than Pandora. This IS about the only positive point of the actual App...  THE BAD: *Downloading/finding my purchased Amazon music is much harder than it should be. I want to be able to separate it from the Prime music, but I don't see a way to do that. *Storage of offline listening music can't be moved, no option for it... *Doesn't resume play once app is shut down. This makes it a terrible music player. I don't really want the app running all the time, but that means I need to remember where I left off... This alone is worth 1 star. *I don't seem to be able to hide anything from it... I listen to one type of music, but I need to purchase other music here and there. I don't want that cluttering things up, but I am astounded at the lack of options in this app...  You can do better Amazon..."
"July 21, 2015","Convention app but I wish thay had more popular songs on prime. I still use Pandora more, more of a selection, however, you dont know what song is playing next, cant go back or play the same song again."
"April 20, 2016","This is an absurd restriction for the price we pay, I should be able to listen on the road while my wife listens on Alexa! DEAL BREAKER!!!!"
"August 9, 2016","I love my Amazon Music! I use this all the time now and it is super easy to understand and mainly download music."
"January 4, 2017","Lots of current hits but, a nice splash for those of us born in the early 60's too"
"August 26, 2016","I love using amazon music because it doesn't have the commercials like the other music apps that I have used."
"September 3, 2016","It seems very hard to use the app..to get music is confusing..to store in cloud or download..very confusing"
"January 17, 2014","Love the fact that all my music is easy to find and play through this app as well as the equalizer feature. Sadly at some point after updating it stopped recognizing my phone. I would also like an exit button as it seems to stay on perpetually even after I've stopped the music.and drains my battery faster. Plays well"
"September 29, 2015","It's a good variety of music and had some songs I liked that I forgot about."
"November 29, 2014","A great selection of music, some of which I haven't heard in a long time (and miss) and quite a lot I've never heard. And the good thing about that is that I can experiment with new genres and if I don't like it - - no real loss, at least monetarily."
"September 23, 2016","There's no app for macs as far as I'm aware. There is a very limited selection of playlists to search."
"February 26, 2016","I love amazon music. I love that I can set up my own category of music and listen to whatever interest I have at that moment. I highly recommend it!"
"September 4, 2016","Grady app. Still has a few bugs. Randomly drops a song mid play sometimes. But great rotation off Music."
"June 28, 2016","When I first downloaded the app it was great. There was a wide selection of music that I could stream integrated with my own music library, but after a few days it started to become glitchy. When I opened another music player, suddenly I couldn't see the song and artist in Amazon on my unlock screen anymore. Songs that I had downloaded to my library and listened to before would now go into endless buffer sessions. I Uninstaller and reinstalled the app, which worked for a few days, but the problems just keep reappearing."
"September 10, 2017","All the music I want at the same place. Just search what you want and it's there."
"January 29, 2017","set up playlists and play them all night for kids' or for me to sleep to...great!"
"December 24, 2016","I really like the radio stations. Wish the selection of artist albums was larger."
"August 16, 2014","Downloaded the app, but it won't play all the music in my library. Won't even recognize most of it. I can access from my kindle but not my android. And d***** thing, I can't even seem to 'reaquire' them purchasing them. That's kinda the whole point of having prime, right.?"
"December 6, 2016","Bye bye pandora!!!!! Love this app!!! And the best part, no commercials!!!! Love it!"
"March 7, 2017","I had purchased quite a few items that could be played on my new Android Phone. The app worked perfectly with totally clear sound.  One thing I could wish for: In the case of complete albums, it would be nice to select from the artwork rather than scrolling endlessly through all the songs. I have 837 songs, mostly from complete albums. To go through that many to select one near the end of the list would be very time consuming. Just a thought."
"July 17, 2016","Had a playlist over 40 hours of music. It stopped playing all Shinedown songs, had to delete playlist and start over."
"April 26, 2017","Love it"
"July 23, 2012","Contrary to Amazon's claims this app is not compatible with the Acer A510. There is no access to playing music from ""the cloud"". I can browse my music and purchase music but forget playing music.  Update - Turns out the issue is with the device. A reboot and the app works fine. This is also the case with a few other apps that were included on the device. So I'll be knocking a star of my Acer review."
"October 29, 2015","I love it but it's just too bad you can only use it on one device at a time. Seriously, how many people are going to have two Prime accounts if they are living with each other?"
"October 16, 2015","it is fantastic that you can have so many choice and catagories and then unlimited advance to next song. I bluetooth this through my new car speakers and bose blue tooth speakers."
"June 10, 2015","I'm an old school kind of music guy (rock/metal) and the majority of the music I have searched for comes back with a ""No results found"" message, and that just doesn't work for me. I'll keep my Spotify."
"November 3, 2016","Amazon prime music far exceeded my expectations ease of use, selection, sound quality...wow"
"May 18, 2015","I really like it but it stinks that I can't just transfer my music from iTunes right over to Amazon files. It says to do it but when I hit the button it doesn't do anything. Other than that it's a very good product"
"July 15, 2016","I have a samsung edge 7s, i use this all the time. It works great on my phone, the PC version not so much. Fantasmic!"
"February 4, 2016","I like the app a lot, but occasionally if I let my phone sit then press play again it will restart the song. It's inconvenient on my 45 minute long mixes."
"September 15, 2015","Love the selection, but wish the widget and the app were more driver friendly. The text and search functions are small, and it takes several clicks to get to my songlist and shuffle all."
"April 29, 2017","I love it. There are so many stations."
"January 12, 2017","Ive used a couple of apps for music but signing up for amazon music was worth it"
"January 2, 2017","Love the music selection. Easy to use, however couldn't sync to a second device."
"September 13, 2014","Will not work on my first generation of Kindle fire HD. So disappointed that Amaon does not make it clear that their own product will not play their own app!! Makes no sense that there can not be an update, but I guess Amazon does not value their paying customers."
"April 2, 2014","The music quality and ease of use are good, but managing the collection can be a problem. If the Imported music is not recognized you cannot manually Name it so I have hundreds of songs with no name or gibberish names!"
"July 16, 2015","Nice"
"September 25, 2017","Great music"
"April 19, 2016","Song selection is awesome!! Any song country R&B soul classical it's there artist selection can't think of one that has never been there"
"February 16, 2016","Disappointed only the primary Prime members can use Amazon Music. I share (household account) Prime membership with my husband and cannot use this app."
"March 4, 2016","Love it, just wish they had newer music. I mean u can buy the newest music, but if I am paying for the Prime membership I shouldn't have to buy it."
"June 14, 2014","According to this app only US and UK are English speaking. Somehow English (Australia) don't exist and the app refuses to run unless I change the whole system settings just for this one app. Not to mention the ridiculous amount of permissions. Guess what I did next amazon music devs?"
"July 17, 2016","How could you not love free Prime Music. Let the program know what you want to hear and sit back for a good listen."
"May 29, 2017","easy to navigate and use"
"June 27, 2014","I was never much of a music streamer, but this latest Prime add-on has made me a convert. I've only found a few albums/songs missing from the free catalog so far. ...And I've listened to so much music I'd always meant to hear. Can't wait to see how it'll expand my musical horizons."
"December 9, 2016","plays exactly the song I want to hear and can always find what I'm searching for!!"
"September 10, 2014","I love listening to my music, and Amazon has so many of the songs I like. I love being able to pick all I want free. I can't imagine not being an Amazon prime member Music, Movies, Books and free shipping on the things I buy what more could I want? Thank you Amazon!"
"July 27, 2014","This is a great app for taking advantage of the 'Prime Music' benefit. The user interface is nice and intuitive, and accessing music is pretty easy. If you are searching for music and something is not prime eligible, then asks whether you want to purchase it. So no 1-click accidental purchases.  The biggest drawback is that you cannot control where the app stores the downloaded files. This is a problem because it saves the downloads on the internal memory which has very limited room. If it weren't for this I would rate this app 5 stars."
"August 10, 2015","music is easy for an old guy to figure out and it has exactly what I like to listen to."
"October 11, 2017","Great choices"
"March 5, 2016","I use this App at home and in my car. I can make my own playlists or use the playlists curated by Amazon. Plus it's free with my Prime membership."
"May 3, 2016","I like the product because I can listen to song I haven't heard in a long time.crystal clear sound and add to your own library."
"June 30, 2017","Hey what happened to the free music with prime.... come on amazon"
"June 20, 2014","I have a pretty eclectic taste when it comes to music, and the selections in Prime Music have been great so far. Over the past 30 minutes I have added 266 songs to my library that cover 8 different genres. GREAT perk for amazon prime members. I don't see any reason NOT to use it!"
"December 27, 2015","Really like the avaliable playlists. Thank you"
"December 7, 2016","I wish there were more station options there are only a limited number of options."
"July 16, 2015","Stations have great variety. Much better than pandora. Pandora had a tendacy to play the same songs over and over (just on different albums). I can easily add any songs to my library from the stations"
"May 5, 2017","Easy to find music, lots of stations."
"May 5, 2017","I love Amazon Music!! Thanks Amazon!!"
"October 16, 2017","🤘👌👍👍🖒"
"August 29, 2017","Good music"
"September 16, 2016","I am so thankful that I have this app. There are so many great gospel songs that I can get for free."
"September 22, 2015","This is so convenient for me to use on my cell phone when at work, or home when studying, or at school. I haven't quite figured out how to use it to its full potential yet, but I will."
"August 31, 2015","Great idea, horrible execution. I hate that their selection and your library are so disjointed. Why cant I just search and play all avalible playlists and songs from the Prime Music webapp?"
"June 12, 2015","Yep. This is needed!!! When I downloaded after many months of trying to avoid downloading anything else, I gave in. I needed a song and I was having issues. As soon as I downloaded this I was super happy."
"August 8, 2015","Good- xray lyrics, playlists easy to create and find, price. Bad-only 1M songs, limited cloud options, search results poorly displayed. Hoping for vast song additions, opening up cloud choices."
"September 5, 2016","Great selection of music. I listen to music while I work out and I like the variety of music available."
"May 17, 2016","Junk"
"May 18, 2015","Mildly surprised with the ease of use of Amazon Music. All my past purchases of CDS are incorporated into my account. Much much better than Pandora which I subsequently uninstalled. Good show Amazon! AT"
"May 24, 2017","I didn't find all the music I had purchased but I did find some."
"August 18, 2016","I GAVE PANDORA MUSIC UP FOR AMAZON PRIME MUSIC..... I JUST LOVE YOU GUYS.... THANK YOU AMAZON PRIME :)"
"July 27, 2016","Great mix of All kinds of music, very good sound quality, much larger overall depth of song choices and artists."
"January 31, 2017","I like the station choices. Takes some time getting use to but pretty good app"
"January 12, 2017","The app was easy to download and the equalizer is amazing. Loving the sound!!!"
"January 10, 2017","I am in love with this app. I use it all the time, especially with my workout."
"January 17, 2016","i'm very happy with my music from Amazon here in my pc but in my smarthphone looks in spanish from Mexico and Spain and i dont want from MX ir _Spain ."
"May 6, 2016","I absolutely love the Amazon Music with Prime Music! I actually haven't had any issues at all. I love it and hope you do as well 😀"
"July 18, 2017","Good!!!!!"
"February 18, 2015","If you already have Amazon prime there should be no reason you're not using Amazon music, great selection of music.  The playest are a very nice feature and you have the option to download the songs you can't beat it."
"March 12, 2016","Only one song would show up on my phone. Spent less then ten minutes trying to troubleshoot. Wanted music on phone not a time consuming project"
"September 24, 2016","Words cannot express the joy of having access to all of my favorite music at home and on the road."
"August 27, 2017","Lots of great music!!!"
"August 15, 2016","As a Prime member, I can tell you it has an unlimited amount of music to listen to. Wow is all I can say!!!"
"May 14, 2015","So unhappy with the app. I don't know why, and I talked with a representative to help me out, I couldn't play or listen to the ""prime music"". I could only listen to the music i bought, which is pointless."
"August 6, 2015","If you have prime, why pay for other station apps? Good quality music and easy to use."
"August 6, 2015","Just recently started using this and has been very easy to navigate through it. Mahalo"
"July 8, 2014","I've install and uninstalled many times and it won't open. Never had this problem with old version. Left email, received an answer but still not working. Just want to be able to load music on my MP3 so I can exercise. Now I have to find another music store that works for me."
"November 11, 2014","Clear Winner!! Its like the radio with out the dj. This is your station you listen to what you want to hear. Not sure what you want to here there's music for that too. Your the DJ & you have an endless supply of music. So let's have some fun!! =>"
"January 12, 2017","I love having a variety of music at my finger tips and so much of it is free!"
"July 19, 2015","On par with Google play music, though the playlists can be a bit disjointed. I generally listen to ""moods"" of music and the playlists generated didn't always match the mood I was going for."
"July 31, 2017","Great with great customer service!!"
"July 31, 2016","It was well worth being an Amazon prime member. The fre musid is now in my phone, car, and desk top at work..."
"June 27, 2015","Amazon music is very good. Packagin it with Amazon Prime is an ideal situation. Free 2 day delivery, streaming video content and lots of Free Music, how could you not love the service. Thank you Amazon."
"April 28, 2016","I think Amazon video has a great selection for free and even the tv shows and movies I have to pay to rent or buy are reasonably priced."
"July 1, 2015","Amazon Music is awesome, I'm on the older side and they have some of the best 50's,60's,70's and 80's albums anywhere. And with prime I get to listen to all my favorites for free.How can you beat that?"
"October 21, 2014","A free trial is just that FREE. Some music is but a large amount has to be purchased even during the so called free trial. Not worth the effort to have or keep."
"July 25, 2017","Family plan for everyone to enjoy music well worth."
"April 22, 2017","Has benefits of prime"
"October 21, 2015","Every channel plays the same music over and over. I can choose top hits, Ed Sheeran, Matchbox 20 still plays all the same songs. All I am asking for is a little more variety."
"May 30, 2016","I really like this app. It has a lot of choices and I love that I can do other things on my phone and still listen to music!"
"November 15, 2016","I love music and with the variety of Amazon music you can't get much better than this!!!"
"September 25, 2014","like it"
"June 19, 2014","I upgraded as Amazon suggested for the new Prime music program, big mistake. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 --- this app WILL NOT run on this tablet. Locks-up tablet and have to reboot. Definitely will delete this junk. Amazon should be ashamed to have released this junk app."
"September 27, 2016","Great channels - love to listen to streaming music while I am out. My life has a soundtrack! :)"
"October 15, 2015","I enjoy the mix of the God praising music which litens my spirit. I humbly give your service 5 stars. Your efforts will not go unnoticed. Thank you and God bless you."
"February 19, 2015","This is great for all your music on the go. Just beware how much data it uses if listening on a cellphone. You will need unlimited data, otherwise you will run the risk of going over your limit. Or use your Cable companies' wifi."
"July 21, 2017","Awesome!!!! I love listening to the music!!! But"
"August 6, 2017","Easy to access, great playlists, and commercial free. Whole family loves it!"
"December 26, 2016","Downloads quickly, but unsure when something is covered or is a charge item."
"January 29, 2017","Love the stations! Just some replay the songs within a short period of time."
"December 30, 2016","Amazon is great, lot of stuff to purchase and very helpful customer servise."
"April 3, 2016","Music is my life. Helps my anxiety too!!!! Love to put headphones on a tune out the world. Thank u Amazon for making it easy to download music!!!"
"January 21, 2016","Have not really used it much but I plan to. I love my music but have not had or taken the time to use and enjoy Amazon. I will take the time soon..."
"May 6, 2016","I LOVE this app. Love having Amazon Prime Music which allows me access to millions of my favorite songs and I can play anywhere."
"May 14, 2016","Excellent selection and variety of music. Playlists for any taste and personally customized. Love being able to download songs!"
"May 15, 2015","With Prime Music there is true access to MILLIONS of songs from every gender for FREE... available from the library at no cost or for a nominal fee.... JUST ONE OF THE GREAT BENEFITS FOR JOINING AMAZON PRIME..."
"May 18, 2016","Really enjoy the Amazon music app. Also it's relatively simple to down load the app and the music. Look forward to more music."
"August 25, 2017","Love my Amazon music"
"June 11, 2017","Works perfect for me"
"December 2, 2015","FINALLY amazon prime has brought a perk to my attention that's actually worth having! You have almost completely replaced Pandora, this is a great benefit of Prime."
"July 20, 2016","Love all the music available. The ability to make your own playlist and play them offline is wonderful as well."
"September 9, 2016","Awsome ! Its the best.no interuptions. Make your playlist or download and very great quality audio."
"December 17, 2016","Limited to purchases only. Prime was ok now have to pay extra for unlimited."
"December 3, 2016","I wish there was a better selection of music. I can't always find songs I like."
"May 20, 2014","Can't tell you how great MP3 is. Especially riding the Metra, my cloud, my picks. Puts you in a good zone. Also great for card night. I get to pick the tunes. Nedd to figure out how to delete stuff I don't want. With Pandora, I have a great combo. One to recommend and one to purchase."
"May 24, 2011","Great app. I use it on a Xoom and it works almost fine. Quite often the player will only play the first few seconds of a song and then jump to the next song in the list. After that, it plays fine.  It could use some better sorting, searching, and filtering (would love to filter by year released)... and a way to change the song metadata, but I'm not gonna complain too much as it's new, and I'm sure there are updates coming."
"August 11, 2013","Amazon MP3 plays wonderfully. But getting music already stored on our computer to this ap was not easy. After many searches with confusing instructions, we figured out how to do it through trial and error. Now that the music is on the phone via the ap, we're very happy."
"November 12, 2016","Can't always find some of songs I like. Nice to be able to download and use offline."
"June 18, 2017","Great collection and diverse musical selection."
"March 17, 2016","Doesn't work for me and customer service is no help. Their brilliant idea id uninstall and reinstall. Like I haven't tried that ten times"
"August 15, 2013","buying and down loading the songs were easy for me before cloud. I buy and can't transfer to my computer or mp3 now. I miss doing it the old way. I'm thinking of removing amazon mp3 and that cloud. I know, I must be doing it wrong. but I see no help to do it right."
"July 16, 2013","I'm not an Android person, but the Amazon MP3 app helped with the transition. The interface and navigation could be friendlier for first time users (maybe a tutorial). After becoming familiar with the product, accessing songs in your Library, Cloud, and Store became a breeze."
"February 29, 2016","Awesome to be able to have access to so much music. Only disappointment is that the service is constantly interrupted with service dropouts...."
"October 18, 2014","Like the selection but when you try and download songs and then play them the app force closes....so I can't play music without streaming it.....please fix this!"
"April 9, 2016","I love prime music. Im able to load music and listen at the gym. If you dont have prime, I highly recommend you research and invest."
"June 6, 2017","Thanks Team AMAZON!"
"September 18, 2016","I would of liked more music, the new songs you here on the radio are not here for the most part."
"October 7, 2015","Better than Pandora because you can listen to entire albums and playlists are ready available if you prefer not to compile your own. There are also playlists to choose by mood."
"May 3, 2016","Love this! There is so much to choose from, they have a lot of my favorites, and love not having to have so much music on my SD!"
"July 20, 2016","Great music selection"
"March 17, 2016","I like that there are no commercials, however a wider range of music would be nice. The stations sometimes play the same songs repeatedly."
"June 13, 2017","Good music selections for Free! The player works fine on my Android phone."
"July 24, 2017","Its the best no one can beat it"
"July 26, 2017","Great"
"July 22, 2015","I enjoy the app, especially out on the boat were we don't have service. It's nice to have music downloaded to the phone. But the app is a bit cumbersome to use. Would like a better interface."
"July 22, 2015","The app and selection are OK, no better than any of the other services out there. Since Amazon tries so hard to push Prime down your throat to use this service, I just give my money to Spotify."
"March 25, 2015","It took 3-4days to get some audio on my Flex! It had problems downloading SO I tried to get it to stop SO it wouldn't run all night NO luck! It finally STOPPED how no clue but it did Show in My Bill! Downloading Sucks!"
"July 28, 2015","The best paid media app ever. I wish you could let me make 4 payments a year though:("
"May 30, 2016","Love it most of the time....until I try to SYNC it in my car ....cars & music go together right? Unfortunately a hassle."
"July 2, 2014","I hate the way it's set up. i can't seem to search for the music i want. it seems like i have to scroll down through the available tracks. i'm a technophobe so i'm probably doing it wrong but there are plenty of people like me who want things to be simple and user-friendly."
"July 16, 2017","works really well!"
"June 28, 2016","I listen to it every day at work and love it. Sometimes it stops playing so that is why I didn't give it 5 stars."
"September 6, 2015","This app won't stop crashing and creates a pop-up every couple of minutes to inform me, interrupting whatever I might be doing. No update available and unable to uninstall. Lameness."
"July 6, 2016","WONDERFUL SELECTIONS!!!!! I'm still very new to Amazon Prime. But, so far I love the music offered to customers."
"August 27, 2014","Seems like whenever I want to access my music, which I directed to be local as well as in the cloud, I can't if the network connection is down. We were camping and had no cell service, so I could do nothing to access my music even with it downloaded. Major fail."
"August 27, 2014","The idea is great but it's not functional. I tried to stream a song by Mercy Me for a camp service in July & it kept stopping and never once got through the entire song. I really want to love it & replace our slacker account but so far it's not an option :("
"September 5, 2015","Glad I discovered it. thanx to a free trial membership to amazon prime. In combination to prime video and prime shipping on orders it is well worth purchasing amazon prime membership"
"July 18, 2017","It's a beautiful and very modern application."
"February 3, 2016","I love the Playlist choices here, whether it is R&B, Classic Rock or Jazz. Also love being able to choose playlists based upon my favorite artists."
"February 6, 2017","It should have a feature to shuffle stations not just listen to one genre"
"December 25, 2016","it just not like the old version off amazon music .... i hate it big time"
"December 20, 2016","It is wonderful to have every song that I can think of at my finger tips."
"January 19, 2017","Very nice selection of music and I love the lyrics that play right along."
"November 28, 2014","The interface is cumbersome and beyond that, the streaming barely works and an exception is throw most times when attempting to listen to something."
"September 16, 2016","Just okay. Songs are removed from Prime without notice but will remain listed in your playlist."
"November 6, 2012","I downloaded this app to replace the same app on my Pandigital tablet. The app became corrupt for some reason. It would not allow me to stream music and insisted I log in to my account. Of course my log in attempts met with a ""Fatal Flaw"" message. The Amazon help files were useless. So far I've had no problems with this app but I downloaded my favorite tunes to the tablet just in case."
"February 20, 2015","I appreciate the Prime music, but streaming the songs can be very spotty, and skip. If I resort to downloading the songs, then I have no issues. Other than that, it's a simple app that could use some performance improvements."
"April 2, 2016","Love it. No ads. Can replay songs, have the lyrics, can save favs to playlist. Excellent Prime feature. Haven't played Pandora since."
"July 19, 2017","It is a good app."
"April 23, 2015","There are a few artists/bands unavailable through the service. However, there is more than of enough music to rebuild my once compact disc collection. In conclusion, I am enjoying my experience via Amazon Music."
"April 11, 2016","Awesome! I love music and have taken full advantage of this. Wonderful variety! Easy to add to playlist. Easy to use. Wide variety!"
"July 28, 2017","I love this music app. Better than the rest"
"May 2, 2016","This is how I get though work every day. The only problem I have is that the app tends to freeze or crash at least once a day."
"December 7, 2016","Gives me the ability to listen to any of my music from amazon. Works great."
"February 14, 2015","Using this app on my Android would be great....if I could actually play music on it. I can navigate all the albums, artists, songs, etc., but when I tap play, I get an error. Every. Single. Time.  The app has NEVER worked properly, unless I only want to navigate through all the songs and never actually listen to anything. In that regard, it's great.  I contacted Amazon Customer Service who basically had me clear the app cache and data about 6 times and then removed all of my other devices from my account, to no avail. It's been 2 weeks and nothing has changed.  I'm sorry to say: for an otherwise outstanding company, they failed me on this one.  UPDATE - I got a new phone and I don't have any of the above issues."
"May 23, 2016","I used to listen to Pandora but now I have switched to amazon music. It's great that it's free with the prime membership!"
"July 18, 2016","The app is wonderful. I was able to transfer my Playlist to my phone so I can listen to it wherever I'm am."
"January 9, 2017","The selection is good, but wish their was more of a variety to pick from"
"May 14, 2015","This app makes it easy to listen to my prime music on my phone. It has all my albums ready to listen to."
"August 8, 2015","I enjoy this feature of Prime. My only complaint is that many of the same sings overlap on various stations. the streaming music does help introduce songs that I may not otherwise hear."
"September 12, 2014","Will not install on Nook HD+. Amazon MP3 player worked fine. Now with the new app I have no way to access all my legal Amazon MP3 files on my Nook. What a way to treat customers.  Wish there were a way to get the old Amazon MP3 player app back."
"December 6, 2016","I'm so happy with this app. I can listen all day long without annoying ads."
"April 25, 2016","Awesome being a prime member with this free music downloads. They could have include the new music for free for being a member."
"April 20, 2016","Happy that Amazon was able to have monthly installment plan, instead of a full payment right away. Thanks amazon!!! 4 caring!!!!"
"February 10, 2015","There are three ways to store your music device, cloud, library and they do not cooperate well. Many downlod very fail. Try another music provider first. If I did not already own music on Amazon, I would not use this app."
"April 25, 2016","This app has been a huge hit with my kids. They each can personalize the listening experience to their preference. Thanks Amazon!"
"June 1, 2016","The Android app is good, what I do not like is that there is almost no songs compared to other companies underwriting."
"August 29, 2014","I don't like that I can listen to my songs on Amazon offline when I have playlist that's on my Amazon acct I should have access to the playlist offline as far as I know I'm not able to download a playlist to my music device that I can play online or offline."
"October 19, 2017","By far the best music app I have ever used. Thank you Amazon. Good Job."
"September 1, 2017","Could be better can't down load new music with out another subscription"
"January 20, 2017","I use Amazon music at work in my car while I'm cleaning. I just love it"
"December 25, 2016","The song limit is crazy. Other cloud storages like Google don't charge."
"January 25, 2017","Like it much better than spotify. Easier to use. Better sound quality."
"June 20, 2014","I need to play around with Amazon Prime music some more, to figure it out, but my initial reaction is not positive. My breakdown after 1 day or so looking at it:  I found it difficult to navigate the app, particularly with respect to what is included as Prime Streaming and what is not. More specifically, it's frustrating that the ""Prime"" (i.e., no additional cost) music is sort of mixed in with all the stuff that is for purchase.  With Google Play Music, it takes some effort to actually go and purchase something. Basically what you find in Google Play Music streaming is available to you for unlimited streaming and included in your subscription cost.  With this service, I'm wary that I might click on something and end up buying it. Maybe that is the point, really.  Amazon needs to clearly separate the ""free"" (i.e.included in Prime subscription) streaming music from the rest for this app to be very useful."
"September 8, 2016","Will not work with Samsung Galaxy 6 does not install or update just keep saying install pending"
"November 23, 2015","Hardly had any of the smaller bands that I like."
"November 20, 2016","I love but an update on windows 10 caused it to stop working on my laptop?????"
"July 27, 2017","Exclusive App - AAA+++ Rating"
"September 30, 2014","I don't understand why I cant get the app to show up on my phone. I had no problem on my i pad but my android and prime music don't hit it off. Amazon needs to fix this. If I had read the reviews on-line I might never have gone for Prime Music. Beware."
"February 10, 2016","Love this app. Have no issues with freezing or anything like that. And it's not hard to download or listen to music through your music library."
"February 1, 2016","I keep getting an error message when I try to open the app. saying it can't authenticate my phone. Purchased music that I cant even listen to. :("
"November 6, 2016","Would be rated five stars if more than one person could sign on at the same time."
"May 23, 2017","Love this song!"
"May 23, 2017","lots of options"
"November 9, 2016","I have prime student trial and no music. That's what I use the most when I study"
"June 20, 2014","This is a nice enhancement to the ""Prime"" package. Already loaded up my phone with tunes that I don't have in my collection already. I hope Amazon keeps adding features like this to the Prime membership. I wonder if they will ever add Audio Books to it? <-hint*"
"March 21, 2016","Had no problems at all and it was simple. It didn't take long at all to install. I kept my music on track with my computer so It worked great."
"August 10, 2015","I have a Motorola Droid 1080x. This totally messed up my whole music library. Be very sure you want to download this!"
"November 21, 2014","Its Ok, really nice music most of the music I like its on Prime, But i got a nexus 4 with android 5.0 and donwload prime music dosnt work any more."
"May 6, 2015","this is one of the perks that come with prime membership. I must say there is more music than I can listen too. There are also meditation and hypnosis apps as well. Theres something for everyone. I love it!"
"June 18, 2014","No thanks. You're selection isn't there yet. My favorites are Tool and Radiohead which are not available. I'll keep it in hopes you get better artists like The Beatles or Pink Floyd and please don't try and cram bad music down my throat such as Christian or County or pop"
"July 2, 2014","The iPhone app is very functional (although the ""sign up"" process was a little confusing). The amount of prime music available is impressive but the length, variety and number of the preset playlists are lacking. Still a great addition to the prime membership."
"September 16, 2016","App won't work on galaxy s6 edge plus. Won't update in either play store or Amazon app store"
"December 15, 2016","Great experience so far....lots of choices and fin to create playlists."
"November 19, 2015","Wisconsin restarting and destroy my battery life"
"June 20, 2014","This is great. I have already downloaded 548 songs 206 albums. You can listen to them all by hitting the shuffle button. I just love it. I would recommend this to anyone especially Amazon Prime members. They have so many songs for free it's unreal. Well, back to my music."
"November 22, 2016","The catalog with unlimited is awesome. Love the ease of using with the Echo."
"October 15, 2015","It's a good app, not the best app for streaming as it crashes from time to time on the OnePlus Two. But when it works, it is nice to have access to all the prime music."
"December 10, 2015","Love amazon very much...I am happy about being a prime member that I can get more free music that I love.Thank you so much.Easy to use and Fast to download"
"June 20, 2014","Maybe the app is good, maybe it isn't--Amazon Prime Music isn't designed to be compatible with my older Android device and Spotify is, so that makes for an easy decision. If you're interested in subscribing to Prime based on the music service, be sure to check your specs."
"April 30, 2015","Just started using Amazon music and haven't had any issues yet!!!!!"
"May 1, 2017","Very good app."
"October 29, 2016","I never thought I'd ever need to give such a negative review to anything Amazon sells much less one of their products but this latest ""upgrade"" of Amazon Music has been a major disappointment to this user/ customer. My major complaint is the inability to upload songs from my laptop to Amazon Music. I've tried numerous times and all I get is the screen with the new logo on it and nothing else. The screen just stares back at me mockingly smirking."
"January 13, 2016","Not running. Error &#34;The specified device coul not be authenticated&#34; Exception #45. I send a report to support but nothing happens."
"August 23, 2016","Better than the one that was pre-installed on my phone. A keeper although I don't use much. (yet)"
"August 14, 2016","Love that I can find all my favorite classic rock music with no problem and great recommended songs"
"October 23, 2013","When I placed my order the screen went right to the final summary. I didn't know what charge card was used. I put in my new address, but the order was sent to my old address. I haven't gotten it yet and the tracking said it was delivered a week ago. No one at my old address has seen it.  Now what do I do?"
"July 27, 2016","Very small song library compared to spotify Amazon: 1,000,000 songs Spotify: 20,000,000 songs"
"August 9, 2016","Would love if you added more traditional christian music like Bill Pearce, melody four quartet, etc."
"November 20, 2016","I downloaded three days ago. It has yet to let me use it. Waste of my time!"
"June 14, 2013","It is nice to buy music and have it available and any device that you have (thanks to amazon cloud) with internet connection. You can also use it with other mp3 files you have on your sister. The only negative happened to me last week when I went to a remote area for a relax mini vacation and my cel phone didn't have internet. But that is life"
"October 6, 2017","Great app with great variety and easy to use interface."
"July 13, 2015","not only was it hard to figure out how to download the app but I cannot use any songs I would like to hear on my mp3 player...still working on trying to get it to run...not happy right now!!"
"December 16, 2016","As good if not better than Spotify!"
"January 15, 2017","iTunes crapped out on me and Amazon Music saved the day. Works great."
"December 31, 2016","Not happy about paying $100 a year and having limited access to music"
"October 4, 2014","It is okay, but it does not share music with other apps on the phone. I listen to music while making long trips in my car and do not like to have to look at my phone while driving and try to change apps all the time for more music. Just my 2 cents."
"December 16, 2015","This is a good product. I love streaming music and has a great selection so I think this would make a great Christmas gift for any family member or friend"
"September 29, 2015","I love having the power in my hand to research items and put them in a wish list or just buy them outright. Combined with prime service and two day shipping can't beat it."
"August 5, 2015","getting better all the time with more selections. Great deal, love the music."
"April 9, 2015","AWESOME!"
"March 29, 2011","These are my initial thoughts after using Amazon Mp3 app fro few hours  Must 1) Lacks Genre tab in the player 2) Lacks a bigger widget with cover art 3) Lacks a lock screen control with cover art 4) Splits up an album if there are different singers on it, this is pointless. Merge it to the album name. 5) Lacks support to upload folders instead of files  Luxury 1) Add an equalizer 2) Add share feature to share via facebook/twitter. 3) iPhone, iPad app :)"
"December 5, 2016","Not sure what the problem is but sure is a lot of static Cuts in and out"
"September 13, 2015","Always hear of this app but never tried until now I regret how could I miss this great feature amazon prime gives. So nice job there I can enjoy more of amazon and keep it up."
"November 7, 2014","Have had no problems. It is especially nice to have when Internet is slow and Pandora and or iheart radio do not work as this still works. I have used for about w years on a galaxy S3 and just transferred it to a S5 it is still working well."
"November 12, 2015","I love this! I had Beats Music but once I got Amazon Music I've not logged into my Beats account. Much better selection and very user friendly. Sounds great too!"
"September 1, 2017","Good selection of songs available for your enjoyment."
"July 21, 2015","Just started this app since I've joined prime. So far what I like is the ability to d.l music and listen to it while offline.  I'll update when I give this a more in depth look."
"February 27, 2016","It's good, missing some of the music I like but it is good. They want 20 words for this review, that's kind of a pain in the ass though."
"January 19, 2016","app is fast and plays good.. only complaint is the selection of music.. there are missing records from some of my fav artists like George Strait."
"May 4, 2015","It is an amazing app to listen music and download a lot of songs from several singers. I love it."
"November 1, 2015","I love that I can download the songs I want... I do wish there was a bigger variety. Seems pretty limited on music. Get more music and I'd be happy to give 5 stars"
"July 24, 2016","There are some songs or cds that I can't find on here that I wish I could but otherwise I love the app"
"July 20, 2016","Oh I just love this! My I pod was stolen out of my car and this is even better. I always have my phone"
"October 5, 2016","It was easy for me to stream I thought it was going to be hard all this time ..."
"September 5, 2016","I just realized i had the amazon prime. Used it for the first time the other day. Loved it"
"November 25, 2014","So far a very useful too when out and about. Takes a little time when not in wifi spot and certainly does not have all my music - not even everything I have purchased from amazon; BUT it takes care of the music fix and very convenient."
"March 10, 2015","It's great! Easy peasy to ise!"
"July 27, 2016","I really like this. I choose the music I like and it keeps playing song after song of tthe same type."
"September 8, 2016","I down loaded this app ios and it suddenly stopped. This is the second time _whats up?"
"April 16, 2015","The music selection is horrible. I searched for 10 different artists and none of them showed up. Searched for a common name artist group and only 5 tracks showed up. How is this unlimited music ???"
"December 25, 2016","Great sound quality and playlist included in prime are good enough."
"July 27, 2017","I'd give this 5 stars, but some band's discography are incomplete."
"August 13, 2017","I think this app is the best one all music is there and really fast"
"May 1, 2016","I love my Amazon music with prime it delivers the best-selling book and it delivers the sounds and lyrics for your music."
"September 20, 2016","There's a great selection of free music. It's great on-demand music without commercials."
"February 18, 2016","Paying for Prime seems useless. This app wont work on my KindleFire hd. It used to work great, now it just puts me back to the home page."
"October 2, 2016","Absolutely love Prime music. It is perfect for listening to what I want, WHEN I want."
"June 21, 2015","What a peach! Commercial free listening, the latest and greatest music offered at your fingertips, multiple devices, what isn't there to love this bonus for being a Prime member. Kudos Amazon!"
"November 6, 2016","The application needs to be able to play and upload more types of music files"
"August 2, 2016","Fairly easy to use, but I hare how diffrent the menus are between my PC and android and then tablet"
"August 28, 2016","It works alright, only downloaded it because I had to have it to play music on my Kindle Fire"
"December 21, 2016","i love the music, no longer have multiple accounts on the other sites."
"August 28, 2017","Works great"
"March 5, 2016","I love no commercials, still having a little problem navigating and knowing if I got it in the library. Would like a CNN news statin"
"July 19, 2016","every month the list changes, what you got through prime one month may disappear the next. frustrating"
"January 8, 2016","I love this player and the ability to stream my music everywhere! I've had no issues, nor have I run into any bugs along the way. Samsung Note 5."
"December 16, 2016","UI is good. A few songs that are on Google music are not on Amazon"
"August 30, 2016","Use this all the time now! What a fantastic app!! Pandora could take some lessons from this."
"June 4, 2017","nowhere as easy to maneuver as Pandora"
"July 24, 2017","It is hard to use with a poor selection I was not satisfied so far"
"January 21, 2017","The best app on my phone. It remembers my choices and I like that!"
"August 21, 2014","I am deeply and madly in love w/ Amazon prime more than ever for adding the free music! Very easy to use. Thank you for making me an even bigger Amazon addict than I already was! Loving this and jammin' out at work every day w/ a dance party in my office."
"January 4, 2017","Putting my Prime Music on my phone for the gym. Ton of free tunes."
"November 23, 2014","Ridiculous amount of crashes on my devices running Android 4.4.4. Have tried installing from Amazon App store and Google play store. This app should be considered alpha and not be released to the general public until it has been fixed."
"June 8, 2017","Like the music selection"
"December 10, 2016","Good overall. Does not has the library as big and varied as Spotify."
"December 15, 2015","I love being able to listen to basically any music for free! I highly prefer this over Pandora or any other music service because there aren't any ads."
"August 11, 2016","The music quality is amazing! As a prime member,there are a lot of popular songs free to listen."
"May 25, 2016","It's rubbish paid for music can't get it on phone use to be able too but now won't let me bring back original app."
"February 4, 2016","I've had the app for abut a week now and have enjoyed it so far. The only thing I see lacking at this time is an equalizer. Please add one."
"February 8, 2016","Works perfectly for me on my phone and tablet. A lot of songs to choose from. Plus it is included in the price of your prime membership."
"June 5, 2013","When i first signed up 2 years ago...it was consistant...performed on the go and worked amazing. Ever sine the updates it is choppy,freezes, and just isnt worth the monthy charge for the cloud. I have stuck woth it in hopes to see smoother running, but it seems amazon has allowed their competitors to surpass them and put out better players."
"December 13, 2016","Great app to search for music especially if you are a prime member."
"February 16, 2016","This app drained my battery! I had no choice but to remove it. Also I would save songs to the cloud playlist and they would not be saved"
"November 13, 2016","Only use this to listen to Taylor Swift since she is no longer on Spotify."
"July 10, 2016","I love the Amazon music app. Having the ability to download free music and play it off line is awesome."
"February 11, 2016","I love this book. Start with a socially awkward brilliant girl, add a hot rich hunk and great girlfriends, and you have a wonderful read."
"November 14, 2014","It stops just short of being on par with another company's Music Offering. But I have to say that the library is vast and the cloud streaming is awesome. This alone makes signing up for Amazon Prime a perfect Christmas gift for someone."
"June 26, 2017","Great. Access to seemingly endless amount of music."
"May 15, 2017","I love it i can find all eras and genre that I like"
"September 5, 2015","OMG.. This Prime Music is the Best. I can skip a song, I can repeat the song just played, read the lyrics, and either use the thumbs up and they respond with ""we will play more like that,"" or thumbs down. ""we won't play that song again.!"" How perfect is that? Love Love Love this station."
"June 6, 2017","Loving the music without commercials!"
"February 6, 2016","When I get in the music mood, this is the place I turn to. I would have given 5 starts, but there are some of my favorite artists missing."
"May 26, 2015","works very well, and PC program is very nice. good for throwing any random songs on, but I wish it had more playlists and artists when I'm looking for a more specific song. its coming along though"
"December 30, 2016","No free music. Totally sucks. I have to use Pandora with my Echo."
"January 20, 2017","Wish it was more user friendly and had more options to pick from."
"July 30, 2016","I stream Amazon Music through my home stereo...it'sgoing whenever I'm home. Easy music selection."
"December 19, 2015","Amazon makes too much $$ off of unsigned Artist / they need to figure out how they can help more instead of just taking 70% of revenue from Artist..."
"August 14, 2014","New version is awesome. I have tried them all, but as a Prime member I settled on this one for my Android devices. The only question is WHY is Prime Music not available on the Fire TV??? If it were, I would buy another box just to have in another room!"
"January 6, 2014","Can't get it to work. All I want to do is play some music in my smart phone. I have some tunes in my Amazon Cloud but what good is that to me. This was free so I can't complain too much. But it someone reads this (seriously) and know what I can, just send me an email.  Thanks, Dean"
"May 8, 2016","Amazon music store should sync up with user's music-related cart items and add credit to free shipping qualification."
"June 3, 2016","LOVE IT!"
"November 26, 2016","I have prime, so why not.....plus the playlists are nice. you cant go wrong"
"October 29, 2017","Love it!!"
"September 21, 2015","Why do I have to keep Amazon open all the time so I can have access to music I PAID FOR. My Carrier might charge me for all the songs I HAVE to retrieve from your CLOUD."
"February 23, 2015","Amazon Prime is worth every dime, and it quickly pays for itself. Obviously postage is saved, though additional benefits (i.e. music, movies, etc) make it an invaluable tool I certainly wouldn't want to be without."
"December 21, 2016","love amazon music just wish i didnt have to pay so much for family plan"
"December 31, 2014","Down loaded the app and found out it uses a lot of memory about the same amount as the whole Operating System on the phone. Didn't like that amount of memory usage. The phone seemed to slow down and the app itself locked up more than I liked. Also noticed it wanted access to a lot of areas on the phone it didn't need to access. Didn't like that at all as it's giving away my data usage and increasing my costs for data uploading data I don't want to give away. Then found out I couldn't delete it or uninstall it. That made me determined to remove it. Which I did by wiping the phone and reloading it. Amazon you want to much information, photos, media info etc. You are increasing my data rates with needless uploads I don't need to give you and you don't need. All that just to hear music no thanks there are better ways out there.On top of that the app isn't very intuitive to use. I won't be reloading it, and would suggest avoiding it, as it's a memory hog and bloats your data rate needlessly."
"March 17, 2017","Love building playlists for running."
"June 28, 2017","Wider selection would be a big plus."
"September 12, 2016","Awesome Love it!!"
"January 27, 2017","With prime it is great can listen to anything and anyone I want."
"August 17, 2016","How could you not love Prime Music? Easy to navigate through and tons of music. I love it!!!!"
"October 3, 2016","Get all your music on all your devices from ,It doesn't get any better than this!"
"October 26, 2011","I had bought another app to transfer my iTunes playlists to my phone. I just couldn't get it to work. I opened Amazon MP3 and found my playlists on their cloud service. I had forgotten that I had uploaded my playlist to their cloud. I just download the playlist from the cloud to my phone and it's all there. You have to put your iTunes playlist on their cloud first, which wasn't a problem, then download or stream to your phone."
"June 16, 2017","Love the music choices"
"May 24, 2017","Great music selection!"
"January 9, 2016","I used it always I like it"
"October 23, 2015","The music stations are great - but I had forgotten that all of the CDs I've bought in the past 5-7 years, are ALSO available to me through this - that's AWESOME!"
"September 6, 2014","There should be a way to keep from buying music accidentally. I have a child and my phone is locked but even the regular Amazon shopping app has the ability to turn off one click buying and probably for a password. Not everything is free with Prime."
"June 15, 2015","Just started trying to use this app and not sure of how it is organized. It is always difficult to change from something you are used to so I am giving it some time to see if it grows on me."
"August 28, 2017","Love it!"
"November 22, 2016","If it wasn't included with my Prime membership, I may have missed out."
"February 12, 2016","Love Amazon music,with prime. I have Alexa and love it. It's in my kitchen and I'm always asking her questions and listening to music."
"March 4, 2016","A septuagenarian that installed and produced magnificent sounds with Amazon music and the Sonos-5 in two hours. I'm pleased !"
"April 19, 2016","I teach pottery and we listen to Pandora music all day & now we listen to Prime Music all day. This is my new favorite!"
"July 30, 2015","Bye bye Pandora! Amazon knocks another streaming service out of the park."
"May 8, 2015","My experience has been very good with Prime Music. I was successful in finding 60s and 70s music going back to the British Bands thru to Woodstock era music. I will be a regular user of Prime Music."
"September 4, 2016","the product provides the opportunity to download and listen offline and no advertisement"
"December 11, 2015","I love the HUGE selection of music and that I can listen to one artist at a time, you don't have to listen to a radio station. Plus, no annoying ads."
"August 7, 2017","Great! But not available for kindle"
"March 7, 2016","I need to build up my library but I could see this being a great app. I need to take more advantage of all of the Prime benefits."
"February 9, 2017","I love the music but unfortunately IT does go off now and then."
"July 25, 2017","So far so good! Easy to use! Even for tech illiterates like me!"
"August 30, 2017","Pretty good selection"
"February 14, 2016","This app gives you the opportunity to download music and play it offline. It's great for working out and running. I'm glad I found it."
"December 19, 2015","This app is easy to use. Amazon often has discounted songs/albums and free previews. I also earn points for new music when I order from Amazon.com!"
"May 29, 2015","My interest is in old time radio mysteries. I can't believe how many choices are offerred. I am however not techno gifted and am having some difficulty navigating around to listen to the shows."
"June 26, 2014","Fantastic way to retrieve great music at no cost! I'm really enjoying this great benefit to my prime membership. Because I live in a rural area, I can't access the video streaming benefits. Prime Music makes my $99 well worth the price. Thank you, Amazon!"
"November 1, 2015","Great"
"May 20, 2016","ive tried it but its not doing what i would like it to do like google play which i like coz i can do what i like"
"June 24, 2014","There doesn't seem to be a way to remove something from the library. I accidentally added an album which I could not remove.  The ability to create stations like Pandora's would be great especially for augmenting the existing library of purchased music."
"April 19, 2016","Its okay, not great not fantastic, just okay,  Sample rate is too low and it cuts too much out of the tracks,"
"December 4, 2016","Son far so good . I use it for my amazon echo. Works like a charm"
"August 1, 2016","Easy to download, every type of music I want and with prime....the price is definitely right!!!"
"August 29, 2015","I love , love ,love this site and all the avaliable music. The choices are as vast as music styles and genre. I've been able to find every song I've looked for on the site."
"July 9, 2015","buffers even with fast home internet and pauses for no reason...thats on my phone...but now i cant download underground or music app on my samsung tab e.....says device not supported...what the heck"
"March 7, 2016","Great selection, and my Android app works great. I use a BT speaker, and I have awesome music wherever, whenever I want. Thanks"
"January 24, 2017","Got my tunes the way I needed them. DRM works fine with these."
"January 10, 2017","I have the application on my phone. The music quality is good."
"April 21, 2016","I like it. It allows me to play a song I like more than once. I can listen to a specific artist or album. Nice app."
"September 2, 2016","I would give five stars however some of the songs I download duplicate for some reason."
"September 1, 2015","Was a little confused @ first. But now understand how it works."
"July 20, 2016","I like old school music, I'very just started give me a chance before you ask me to rate your app."
"September 10, 2016","Great app, great music, great streaming. Can't go wrong with Amazon Music with Prime."
"August 3, 2014","Dont care for the app. When I buy music I like to fell like it's mine. Had to spend time learning how to get a copy onto my laptop. Amazon programmers should be fired."
"August 4, 2015","There are a lot more free albums and songs than I could have hoped for."
"September 26, 2015","Unfortunately, I cannot rate this fairly. I was trying to sync my music library to my new cell phone. I really don't know anything about this Prime Music app."
"October 9, 2016","Very good selection. Just don't like how every station plays the same 50 songs"
"May 30, 2017","Great."
"June 14, 2015","Anything you want to hear, anytime you want to hear it. One the best benefits of Prime. Let's face it, the FREE 2 Shipping cannot be beat! Their pre-made Playlists are right on the money."
"August 10, 2014","This app will crash . I have it on a tab 3 8.0 and when I try to down load from recently added music . The app crashes so bad that it wont even finish sending it's own error report . Amazon prime can and should do better if they want my next renewal ."
"May 2, 2016","Love that there are no commercials/advertisement. Thousands of artist and song to chose from. Easy to use/download."
"June 20, 2013","It was a bit difficult to negotiate. I wanted to be able to find particular songs more easily. This is somebody who's just begun using it, so no doubt there is a learning curve. So glad I chose to save my songs to Amazon's cloud, though, because it's not eating up memory and I won't lose them no matter what happens to my devices."
"October 7, 2015","Seems have a lot of great features and variety, but I have used Spotify for so long that I am going to stick with it. Plus it is connected to my Facebook account."
"March 20, 2016","Great Benefit of Prime Membership. Can't beat FREE music. Current Hits and Oldies. 5 stars for selection, channels and genre"
"May 31, 2016","pretty nice, it played on my headset via Bluetooth from my Galaxy S4 right out of the bat. Pretty impressive"
"May 5, 2017","i realy love using the amazon music for android"
"March 16, 2016","This app is so intuitive. Without a bunch of messing around. Smaller selection of songs through Amazon, but the app is great."
"September 8, 2017","access to music I would not have."
"February 28, 2017","Needs to add more of a selection."
"August 10, 2017","I absolutely LOVE it. Any song I want right at my fingertips."
"December 20, 2016","Great! I can find any song and the music quality is awesome."
"January 28, 2017","Works good on tablet . Does NOT work with Windows phone."
"July 20, 2014","amazon streaming music does not work on my kindle. And you cant download the app. ive tried the mp3 app on my android its more trouble than its worth no sdcard so i sideload or use dropbox. no app at all for my windows phone. I don't think they get it."
"February 2, 2016","Only had it for a short time, but so far I'm really happy. I like being able to use my phone if I'm out in the field to listen to music!"
"December 23, 2014","This service streams well and is very quick. If they have the artists you like on Prime your in good shape. I have been fortunate so far as a lot of my favorites have been free. All things considered a great service so far."
"October 30, 2014","Nice"
"October 2, 2016","All of my favorite music, commercial free, and all part of my Prime membership."
"June 26, 2014","I like how easy this is to use with my Android. The free music is awesome--especially some of the playlists; I was introduced to new, beautiful music through some of those. I would definitely recommend it to a friend!"
"November 23, 2016","Love the Music App!! The only issue I have is my data plan limits."
"August 18, 2015","Fast and easy, but missing some very important and/or new artists."
"November 14, 2014","ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! The selection I'd great vwand. Easy to use. The prime radio station has turned me on to artist and songs I had never heard and ended creating Playlist to play on all of my devices.  Great new service."
"July 31, 2015","great app. love that with prime you can listen to a bunch of free music"
"November 23, 2014","This app shows it has been downloading one song for 1.5 hrs. As you can see i can be very patient preson but this is rediculious. I will try later when i have more time to call technical support and have 10.3 Blackberry software."
"June 14, 2015","Drained my phones battery, always on, used up 2gb data by itself in the span of an hour. Music is hard to get transfered over to it even when bought from the website... really not pleased"
"September 5, 2017","Great"
"April 19, 2016","There's so much to choose from, it's almost overwhelming. I'm enjoying the variety of genres available to listen to."
"December 12, 2016","Great sounds more than I can ever listen to....Life is Good..."
"May 30, 2015","I love the music it's non stop no commercial if u are looking for music this is the place to be.... I listen to this at home in my car and at work it's great I give it five stars all the way"
"November 7, 2014","Honestly, app is difficult to navigate. No good music available. Needs some major work. Needs at least some new music. Integration between links very slow. I use raphsody, pandora, and slacker. This ranks below all of them, for now."
"September 6, 2015","Slow to load but very convenient. I do have a large collection to load but Amazon tech service said that's not the reason it's slow. They did not say what IS the cause."
"August 15, 2015","I prefer buying my Android tracks here because there's no confusion about downloading what you purchase. It's a simple, user friendly app I come back to time and time again!"
"May 11, 2015","It's a great service, don't get me wrong, but it would be greater if we could create separate user profiles so a parent could see their recommendations and a kid could see theirs, as an example."
"August 2, 2017","I really like it but is it costing me money???"
"October 2, 2016","I have this on my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and I use it almost daily. I love it!"
"February 4, 2016","some of the functions were difficult to learn to use. okay now that i am use to it. missing lots of music i had wished would be there"
"April 12, 2016","I was not happy with prime. Downloaded a song and it never showed up on my list. Never found it. Deleted prime. ."
"December 24, 2016","i dont recall ordering this i didont or will not be using it"
"August 1, 2014","It's nice that a lot of music is free but even with the download feature you can't play the downloaded music with other players that you may like better. The phone use to not be able to sleep while playing music but they fixed that in a recent update."
"March 25, 2017","Useless - The app crashes and restarts my phone every time I try to fast forward a song. Using on my Samsung GS5."
"September 10, 2016","Well I pay for Amazon prime and can not use the player, keeps giving me error codes"
"September 21, 2017","cool"
"August 10, 2015","great music when I want to hear it not when the station wants me to"
"November 21, 2016","It would be nice if you people would have something that did work."
"July 18, 2016","I love music especially when out sailing I take the Bluetooth speaker and just go. That's great"
"August 22, 2016","Amazon is doing great at keeping the music coming with all varieties. Keep 'em comibg."
"August 2, 2016","I love it. I have not found if favorite station scan be created per Pandora. If so, 5 star."
"March 3, 2016","I love my Amazon music involvement. Utilization of my Amazon Cloud and the Prime music program is TERRIFIC. I am so enjoying ."
"December 2, 2015","Prime is Amazing! Love not having to drive 30 or more miles to buy stuff. We live is a small rural town. Free shipping and fast delivery. Yay....😀"
"March 15, 2016","I wanted so much to use amazon for everything related to music, but this app is horrible. And tech support is horrible too."
"October 17, 2017","I was never able to use it. Kept giving me an error message"
"February 19, 2017","Love the fact I could purchase inserts for my ugg slippers!"
"July 30, 2016","So far i love it, doesnt have some soundtracks or alot of kiss music but im impressed so far"
"November 29, 2014","This app is not compatible. I downloaded it but it won't play any music. I have to save the music from amazon music to my phone and play it on the phones music player. Very disappointed. This phone is not old it's new in 2014."
"March 30, 2015","I just love this app. Works great on my android phones. I just wish they made one for my windows phone."
"November 2, 2016","So easy to use and has sooo many songs to listen to. I am loving it.."
"July 22, 2015","I love the different ""stations"" I can listen to so conveniently."
"April 21, 2015","Can't stream music from the cloud unlees you uninstall and reinstall the app. Talked with tech support a few times they have no explanation. I stream from several other places and have no problems."
"May 30, 2016","Amazon Prime Music allows free cloud storage which is simply awesome! Great for this Memorial Day cookout."
"February 23, 2015","I don't care for this at all, I was interested but when I wanted to listen to a song it wanted me to download an app. Okay fine, however then the app says it can make all these changes to my phone. Not okay."
"November 9, 2016","Wanted me to provide credit card details before even getting started"
"September 22, 2014","This app started out okay for my purpose. I bought the music, it went to the app, and from there I was able to download it down to my phones music player. Until after a couple of hours of getting music. Now none of my purchases go threw."
"November 30, 2016","I love listening to the Amazon Music. I listen all day at work."
"April 19, 2016","I Bluetooth my music to a speaker outside and it is continual play and I can select genres for a variety of people."
"August 17, 2015","I also have Rhapsody and in my opinion Amazon Music is superior."
"February 15, 2016","Fantastic way to access music for any occasion, any where. Mostly use in background when visiting Mother at assisted living home."
"April 23, 2015","It's nice having a library, great being able to put things I like directly into it. The playlist are lacking in my opinion, but that could easily be remedied if I took the time into making my own."
"August 13, 2016","Easy to use but i wish the interface was easier and friendly to use as it is really ugly"
"September 23, 2014","I don't need another music player. I just want to download my music onto my devices and play it. I do not need or want to be connected to any cloud."
"July 18, 2017","Better than pandora hands down"
"February 10, 2017","Great way to get all your music without spending a fortune"
"January 30, 2017","On many occasions the music of my choice was not available"
"January 30, 2017","Excellent APP and very easy to use. Great music selection!"
"June 11, 2015","This is awesome!!!!! I'm finding so many cool lullabies to put my baby to sleep that I never would have found otherwise! I just wish the searches in the app gave more than 25 results."
"April 3, 2015","This is such an awesome perk of a prime membership! There's so much music to choose from! And the best part is, you Dont have to pay anything extra. Its all included as part of your prime membership!"
"February 9, 2016","Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service. I would Definitely buy again and I would recommend to my friends"
"March 1, 2016","I love amazon music. Only complaint is that there isnt too many new releases uploaded. But i love the selection they do have"
"December 22, 2015","I've decided to look up all my old vinyl favorites & added so many to my Playlist. Now when I want to fall asleep I put on my favorite songs."
"May 16, 2016","Second greatest part of prime. You get to listen to a lot of music commercial free!!! So much to choose from"
"October 8, 2013","had issues with poor reception on LG phone. Now incompatible with Samsung phone...FRUSTRATION...Now Amazon account still reflects LG phone and won't update with new Samsung info...more FRUSTRATION... Now I can access music from cloud but only on pc ...then must transfer ... more frustration and irritation..."
"May 24, 2016","New to Amazon music, I would like to see a guide to explain what is the difference between all the options"
"September 6, 2014","I really enjoy the Playlist options and just need more time to learn how to navigate the site faster. I'm not very savvy about this kind of site (I'm 52 with minimal exposure to such sites). My only regret is not downloading the app sooner!"
"September 6, 2014","I ditched my Sirius subscription in favor of this. I believe I made an excellent choice. Now I get to choose the music I listen to with the added benefit of being able watch movies for free and have Amazonprime purchases shipped to me free."
"December 3, 2015","Love this...easy listening, I can listen to baby different genre's all in one sitting within my library is 3 more convenient them my xm radio. 😄"
"February 20, 2015","Some free music. Confusing trying to negotiate back to your choices and selections. Constantly interrupted by attempts to sell totally unwanted music. You can do better amazon. Google Play is much better."
"May 3, 2017","I love this... Use it daily."
"February 5, 2016","A lot of the music is outdated or is just not losted. I can hear numerous of the ""new"" tracks on the radio 2 weeks before."
"October 12, 2016","I did not dislike the music I think it new more update songs and artists."
"August 1, 2015","When accessing the app on my IPod it can be rather difficult to do.....Then I can not search for a lot of artist on through there as well... Up date the app or change it...."
"July 8, 2016","Has a few glitches which makes it force close. If it was fixed I would give it a higher rating."
"June 15, 2015","wow. just wow I think there might be an actual person behind the song selections. my own playlists songs from the whole Amazonian jungle to build from. I love it."
"July 13, 2015","I do like the free music that comes with prime, but this app feels a bit buggy and kind of slow. Also the selection of prime music is not very good, but I guess that's expected."
"February 17, 2016","Prime Music is definitely a great place to find what you are looking for and so many of my favorite artists and music is there."
"August 12, 2017","great music app"
"October 22, 2015","I am really enjoying my play list. The song selections are great with various choices. Download streaming from the Bluetooth and listening thru the radio."
"March 15, 2014","I have been looking for an app where I can purchase the music I like so I can download it to my Galaxy 4! This was the app that I could do that with! Also any music that I buy is stored in my ""Amazon Cloud Player"" and it doesn't get any better than that! Love this app!"
"November 2, 2016","I use to love this app and then it updated and I keep having issues with it. When I am playing offline it keeps stopping and telling me it can't connect to the internet. And if I shut the app down it doesn't remember what I was playing. So I have to start my play list over. I wish I could go back to the old app."
"March 8, 2017","I love this app. My only issue is songs being available and then, poof, pay only."
"November 7, 2015","Easy to navigate, good songs, no adds, great overall music app. Had to subtract a star because closing the app completely can be a little frustrating."
"September 29, 2011","I love this store ever since I left Itunes a couple of years ago because Itunes had only protected songs and could not use it on my other MP3 devices. Thanks to Amazon MP3 I have never gone back and all there songs are high quality and also has a large library of songs. This app easily allows you to buy and download songs very quickly and any other songs you have stored on the Amazon Cloud is also accessible thru this app."
"December 3, 2013","This is the best way to play your favorite tunes with or without WiFi. You buy your music (the prices are very reasonable- to cheap) you download IF you want it on your device for anytime, anyplace listening. Or you can leave your tunes safe in the cloud so it does not take up any storage, you start the wireless and listen that way. Either way, the selection is nearly infinite. All the old classics to the newest hits....And best of all; NO Commercials! And you don't have to listen to anything except what you want to hear. For listening on your phone or tablet, this is the real deal. No hidden fees. No upgrades. Just straight out jamming Your Way!"
"December 3, 2015","I really like this music service, pretty good library and no adds. It allows me to download to SD card which is great. Great addition for Prime."
"June 6, 2015","Love it!!"
"August 1, 2016","Have not used this as much as I should. But I do like the selection of music and themes."
"June 20, 2013","When I ordered this app I thought it was compatible with my Kindle Fire HD.... Unfortunately it wasn't, none the less to my surprise it works great on my smart phone! The loss of one star is for not being compatible with my Kindle Fire. I do recommend this app for any smart phone with the Android operating system! :)"
"November 2, 2015","Amazon Music does not create a radio feel, unlike Pandora I have to waste time creating my own stations and hence never get a chance to find new music."
"March 7, 2016","Average amount of music available. Seems that all popular new music still needs to be purchased in order to listen to it."
"February 27, 2016","There is no variety for Prime members."
"August 8, 2016","Live amazon music! Wide variety of selections, can even download albums!! My new go to!"
"October 8, 2017","The best streaming music I used"
"May 2, 2017","Awesome music app! No issues what so ever!"
"January 3, 2017","Works great, I forgot I even had a library started here."
"January 7, 2017","Doesn't have as much music as I thought, but still good."
"January 19, 2017","the mobile app stops playing requiring numerous restarts"
"November 23, 2015","Needs work on being user friendly"
"August 16, 2011","It's not all that sophisticated of an App, but it serves the purpose. But it works great for me because I use several phones (one for each region I frequently travel to) and it's nice to have my music with me whenever I want to play them. Best part of it is I don't have to load down the already limited memory of my phones with the entire library. I can just stream the playlist (or artist, album, etc.) that I want to listen to."
"August 23, 2017","Love this app."
"June 16, 2013","I love the idea of MP3 music, available at home or ""on the go"". If you love music like I do, it's so great to have it available on my ""smart phone"", to practice dance steps, to share the song with someone, someone special, or just for a personal memory. I didn't know how enjoyable this part of music could be."
"April 10, 2015","I don't even understand why I would need a music app on my kindle it should just register my prime account on the music tab. no matter though because the app won't even install onto my tablet. SMH"
"December 8, 2015","What the hell is this? A specific recording? Any of them? The Music app on Android??? I've never played any music via Amazon, sooooo......"
"May 23, 2015","Doesnt stream. Can only use it at home and does not work all the time at home either"
"November 21, 2015","Pandora and Iheart have nothing on Amazon Prime Music. Music is new, you can create your kwn playlists and cloud library. Stations are amazing."
"May 20, 2016","I love Amazon music there is such a giant selection of all kind of music that will please any music lover"
"February 3, 2016","I love that since I have a subscription I do not have to pay for most songs that are on prime I just add them to my song list. :)"
"January 2, 2014","This is a nice and easy way to listen to your music. The interface is simple to use and is a must use for your daily music needs."
"April 28, 2016","loved receiving my music instantly . I can download it to my comp, listen to it from my phone or stream online"
"January 2, 2015","I would love to give it more but I have to honest it's not consistent. It takes time to upload or start up, and there is no ""smooth"" transition between songs. I like the ease of buying the music but it slow."
"May 8, 2016","Love amazon prime music, as there are no commercials. Unlike those other music apps, this is my go to music app."
"June 26, 2015","I have enjoyed using this app. I have the sirius app also. In the gym, sirius does not always work. Amazon music seems to come in at all times with little service interruption."
"August 10, 2015","good selection, easy to use format, unlimited skips with prime."
"January 28, 2016","It works great but when I installed my virus protection warned me saying some type of infection push ads I think it was please fix"
"September 28, 2015","Love it! Easy to use and lots of great free music. I love Amazon prime and would have it if it didn't come with Amazon music, so this really sweetens the pot."
"November 21, 2016","Love streaming my amazon prime music, no longer need my Sirius"
"March 29, 2016","Easy to use and great for offline or radio style music just need more recently released songs but over all fantastic"
"November 12, 2016","I still don't know why I have this, but it hasn't hurt anything."
"October 17, 2017","Easy to use and find it he music you like"
"May 1, 2017","Splendid, superior to Pandora and spotify"
"December 22, 2016","I like it.. just wish the album's wouldn't disappear..."
"January 17, 2017","Recommendations for the music selection are on point..."
"January 18, 2017","I use it in the car! I enjoy playing all my favorites!"
"January 31, 2017","a decent music service with a varied selection of music"
"January 16, 2017","Pay the money for Music Unlimited, you won't regret it!"
"February 4, 2016","It's fabulous! A space taker for sure but other than that, it's great to have a song pop in to your head and voila there it is!!"
"October 22, 2015","It is pretty nice. The down side is you have to have coverage or the music won't play.It is not downloaded to your phone but rather streamed through it."
"July 20, 2017","Very good mix"
"March 12, 2013","This is something I really enjoy. I don't listen all the time, but there are many occasions when I just want to listen to my own favorites. I like it that I can listen to my music with my smart phone. I can see the day coming when I don't care to even have a cd. I like the convenience and the simplicity of pulling my music from the cloud."
"June 15, 2014","The music selection has a fair number that I like, but the biggest drawback for me is the app for my Android tablet. It has no shuffle play within a disc and no shuffle play across discs. I was hoping for a mini radio station with only my chosen artists."
"June 29, 2015","LOVIN IT"
"November 24, 2015","Love listening to all the great music Amazon has! So convenient when you are on the go all the time just to use the app for the hits you love!!"
"July 30, 2015","This thing is awesome!!! So much better than Pandora and free!!!!"
"May 31, 2016","I think it's better then all other services Simple to work with for selecting songs and stations"
"June 30, 2016","Love the ability to try out music I wouldn't otherwise pay for. Expanding many taste in music."
"December 11, 2014","first couple days I liked it after that I don't know what happened to my music I don't know what happened it disappeared off my phone but I don't need I didn't like when I played music that it would cut out their songs"
"October 20, 2016","Met and exceeded expectations, delivery was quick and free for Prime"
"February 1, 2017","Im still testing this app, so far its keeping me busy."
"September 10, 2017","great music, love the selections for any mood your in."
"January 12, 2017","Easy to use. Wide variety of music. I love this app!"
"April 30, 2016","It doesn't have enough music&a lot are not the original artist.I see if you want good music you have to pay!"
"December 7, 2016","great app, keep it up Amazon, can wait to see whats next."
"October 22, 2015","Great deal, wish it hadn't taken me so long to actually try it. I have the greatest playlist ever (in my mind) and I didn't pay anything extra for it."
"May 11, 2017","Like it !!!!"
"December 5, 2016","Can't install on my phone and can't get music I paid for."
"November 7, 2015","When trying to play anything from my library over Bluetooth in my truck, songs just stop playing. No problem steaming music with other apps though."
"April 19, 2016","Love that I can access even more music now and all for such a good deal (especially with the student discount)"
"November 26, 2016","This application works great and downloads your music fast."
"September 27, 2016","Pretty solid. I love the follow along lyrics feature on some of the songs"
"June 23, 2014","I added it to my Samsung phone and now can listen anywhere.... just wish I could figure out how to get something like this on my Kindle. I know there is a way but can't figure it out yet. Managing the music on Amazon Prime on my home computer is a snap."
"November 25, 2016","Great service. Saves all my purchases got future downloads."
"July 5, 2015","I would like it better if I could figure out how to set parental controls. My kids listen and we are constantly having to skip past explicit songs. Need a way to block them."
"November 20, 2016","Difficult to use on kindle. Good selection of music, though"
"September 25, 2016","Great connection, use friendly. Favorite time to use isv as the the gym!"
"April 30, 2016","I didn't know it cost $99.00 I assumed it was free, until it got shut down. The music stations were awesome"
"July 22, 2015","Love this app! Being a prime member also has its benefits here too"
"January 11, 2017","All I need...too much music...Prime makes it perfect!"
"June 16, 2017","Easy of use. Great sound."
"January 27, 2016","Good option"
"May 1, 2016","I absolutely love the ease in which I can either choose my own music and makes playlists, or go to the different genres and choose from there. It makes it so easy to exercise or walk with, and yet I can relax and read to the music also. The different groups, such as amazon music for walking, update constantly, and I do not have to go to the web site to do it. Makes listening to the music fantastic. My only problem with this is that I can access movies while travelling outside of the US, but not the music, You have to download it. Hurry up and get the musical access also!"
"May 8, 2015","Love amazon music. Wish all my favorites where there but my Lord tbe selection is awesome. Especially love the preset playlists tbey know bow to place the right groups and songs together."
"March 25, 2011","*** It should be noted that I wrote this review before Amazon converted this app to the ""cloud player"" so even though this app has the same name as the current one, there may be significant changes in how it works now. ***  You can search, listen to samples, and buy songs with this app. However, there are no user controllable settings and it gives VERY little information about the song or the album while shopping. You also must sync this to your amazon shopping account and enable one-click purchases to make it work.  This is a very basic app, which is a good thing to some degree... that's what keeps it simple. I'm glad it's not trying to be everything under one roof. I don't want it to be a music player and do all sorts of other annoying stuff like iTunes does. However, it is so limited that it's hard to feel like it's easy to use because the limitations require other work-arounds.  ~~~Shopping Experience:~~~  When shopping for songs or albums, there's no description, reviews, or anything else other than the artist, title, and a date (which is not explained--is that the release date or what?).  Being able to listen to song samples so easily is a very nice feature. It's quite easy to search for a song, quickly find it, and listen to a sample before buying. It's great if you're not sure what song you're looking for.  There are some strange things about it though. For example, several songs and albums I searched for have two versions of the same song for two different prices. Songs from the same name, artist, and album sometimes show up as two separate listings for $.99 and $.89 with no explanation of the difference. Are they different bit rates or something? Different formats? With no explanation available and no extra detail about the song... who knows what you're getting.  There seems to be no way to put songs in a cart and buy them all in a single purchase. You must activate one-click on your amazon account to use this app. I just started using it so I haven't seen the credit card bill yet, but the way this works makes it seem as though there's going to be a separate $.99 charge on the card for every individual song you buy. This seems a little tedious. I would love to buy several songs at once in a single transaction.  It would also be nice to buy up a credit balance for the phone like a gift card so I could just purchase songs as I discover them and have the cost deducted from my balance without paying for each separately. I don't want to have to share that with my other amazon web shopping however, so I'm not sure if a traditional Amazon gift card would work. It's all pretty poorly explained. If I were going to use this app a lot I would be tempted to create a new amazon account specifically for this app so I wouldn't have to commingle settings with my web shopping.  Also, there seems to be no way to retrieve previously-purchased songs later on if they get lost or deleted. It would be really nice if it would put the song in a queue to download next time you sign in from your computer so you can easily use it there too. Currently I copy them from my phone to the computer... so why not just buy them on the computer and copy them to the phone? That's not any harder or easier so it contributes to my point that while the app is easy in itself, it requires a bunch of extra work to get the full value out of your music purchase thereby negating the so-called convenience of the apps simplicity.  ~~~App Experience:~~~  Because there are no user controls, you can't specify what folder the songs get put into or where it is located. Neither of the music players on my phone are able to find the amazon mp3 folder on their own (even after refreshing the media list) and therefore are unable to show and play the new music. So I had to install a file manager app, and each time I buy a song I have to copy the it to my normal music folder.  Finally, the documentation for this app sucks. Actually working the app itself is pretty easy and self-explanatory (mostly because it has no features other than searching for songs and pressing the buy button), but it requires a whole bunch of coordination with your amazon account and its settings and the implications of all the little things you do are not at all evident. Everything is very poorly explained, if at all. You have to fumble through all the steps until you figure things out on your own. Then for the few topics they offer help with, it's takes you to a web page for an explanation... but comically, it's not a mobile-friendly web page so you have to zoom in and scroll left and right to read the lines. Seriously? These are web pages written specifically relating to a mobile phone app, ostensibly to be read primarily on a mobile phone, yet they're not in a mobile friendly format. Big fail.  ~~Summary:~~~  As powerful a site as amazon.com is, I'm a little surprised at how incredibly basic this app is. The way it works now, I find it much easier to just buy the songs from the amazon web site with a computer, and transfer them to the phone manually. The only time I envision using this app is when I'm away from my computer and desperately want a song right away."
"June 29, 2016","nice web site ,I tried it but, I have unsubscribed to the site now, not what I'm looking for."
"May 12, 2016","Has moments when it stops playing due to bandwidth but overall great sound quality and up to date music!"
"August 12, 2017","I liked it."
"September 13, 2014","Shuffle mode is a joke algarythms messed up it always starts with the same song every single time time I'll stick to my Google Play thank you music"
"July 7, 2016","Head and shoulders above Pandora, way more music choices. A bonus for having Prime service."
"February 3, 2016","Great stations to follow...tons of artists to save to your library! Love the suggestions based on your listening selections :)"
"July 24, 2016","This plays music well and has a variety of music to choose from, it's a good app so far"
"September 27, 2016","I enjoy the selection of music and I enjoyed the music that I downloaded"
"October 14, 2016","Love Amazon music. Doesn't work all the time, but is still worth it."
"July 23, 2016","I've had a lot of music apps and this one is def my fave. I like it better than iTunes."
"July 19, 2016","A great organizer and a fantastic way to obtain and organize as well as play your music."
"September 27, 2015","I like it but the selections for the artist in the r&b sections don't fit . For example in the earth wind & fire section, why am I hearing Jahiem."
"April 27, 2016","I enjoy that as a Prime Member, I can listen to so many of my favorite songs! A great perk of amazon prime!"
"November 12, 2016","It kept giving me error messages and I could not download it."
"August 13, 2016","Again, good....but it even was capsuring my voicemails....privacy is so long gone."
"February 5, 2016","Really great! I use it every day, there is so much available. The variety is exactly what I'm looking for. Thank you Amazon!"
"October 19, 2015","Selection is not as complete as other options. But I do like it as a bonus perk of prime and still has plenty to listen too. Including music for kids!"
"December 28, 2015","This app is great. It allows me to search and listen to what I want to hear and add songs to my playlists. This is an easy to use app."
"January 6, 2014","Extremely frustrating!! Amazon keeps telling me that my password is not valid. I keep changing it and they keep saying that it is not valid. I can easily access the cloud music from my PC.......phone doisn't know that it exists....just keeps telling my the my password is not valid."
"January 7, 2017","Love to add the most of the music I want to hear...."
"July 8, 2017","Really good overall app."
"April 30, 2016","All of our family favorite songs in one place, it works great and we love all the free music and games. Thank you Amazon!"
"January 4, 2016","I LOVE this feature for Prime Members. I like that you can download all the songs you want and play them off line from your library."
"June 19, 2014","I love the fact that you can access many different songs including playlists. What I don't like is that when you use the app and click on recently added, it doesn't sort by artist or album. I'm not sure how to accomplish this because it is not clear"
"April 25, 2016","I love creating my own Playlist with such a wide variety of music. Keeps me going through a tough work day."
"April 4, 2016","I give this app a -10 (minus 10). It crashes constantly. I can be surfing the Web on my phone or checking my email without listening to music and it crashes interrupting what I'm doing. Tech support says uninstall the app. But when I do this it deletes all the music I downloaded. Then it takes time to redownload my music(have over 3500 songs) mainly full CD's. And not having internet at home this causes problems. Last time I did this it hijacked over 500 songs from another music from my other music player along with duplicating 300 of them(over 800 additional on my SD card). So I hesitate to uninstall it again for fear of losing my songs from the other music player. In addition I now have I have several CD'so that I purcased from Amazon that are now on my other music player. When it crashes if I don't select report the crash the music still plays, however I can't see what's playing.   I have a Samsung S4 with 16GB internal and a 64GB SD card. Found the best work around is to force a stop on the app and delete cache, restart the phone then try again to play music.  Is this anyway to listen to your music? DON'T THINK SO!!!! Wish they could get their act together!!!!"
"August 10, 2017","I like it."
"February 16, 2016","Excellent! I am able to use it at the office on my laptop, the selection is great, easy to use, and I highly recommend it!"

"August 6, 2016","I am able to enjoy music anywhere! I like the variety of music on this awesome app!"
"May 29, 2015","This music streams so well, it is like having all these CD's in your own home,car or office without having to lug them around. The best deal I have gotten for myself in a long time."
"April 19, 2016","Good movie! Changed the whole timeline and set the franchise up for a whole new series, either movies or tv."
"September 10, 2015","Love this app! When I purchase a lot of my music on CD, I most often get an auto download as well. Love that ability to access through phone or MacBook Pro."
"April 23, 2014","Company is good and, I wouldn't mine working for them. It's been super. I wouldn't mine a little more transparency when it comes to product reviews and possibly offer some deals like no interest if the product is paid off during a pre determined period of time."
"December 11, 2014","Great way to listen purchased on songs from Amazon. Not sure if it will be accepting of any MP3 - never required it... However, it's one way to stream MP3's purchased on Apple (no file system) such as an iPad...!!"
"July 30, 2014","Very hard to work with. Does not let you download your music lists. the Amazon people are so nice but are no help at all. It is just a very poor music player"
"December 1, 2015","We have one prime account for the house and each have our own login. Unfortunately only one us us can use it and that one person isn't me."
"March 11, 2016","Good selection, not great..still need other sources for most of my music. I would pay for Youtube once this is over."
"March 7, 2016","Love this app so much! How can you live without this? There's so much music to explore. It's so wonderful. Get this now!"
"September 4, 2015","I didn't get Amazon Prime for Prime Music, but it is one of my favorite benefits of it. I love being able to listen to all types of music any time of the day."
"December 6, 2014","So Amazon has refused to let me continue selling product on their site (after 10 years of allowing me to),even thought I have provided copies of my invoices, as I sell from multiple locations... the address on the invoice doesn't match the address on the seller account. As 'compensation' for this, they offered me a $300 'credit' on black friday goods. The items were picked, and all that was left was my payment for the difference in price. The agent who was working on this... stopped responding via email. The agent who was chatting.... stopped responding to chat.  So, I am left with product I cannot sell.... and the empty promise of compensation that will never happen.  In the meantime, Amazon continues to lose money, and business in general.... and we wonder why?"
"May 8, 2015","Love the fact that this app doesn't geo-restrict you to a certain region to listen to your favorite music unlike other competitors out there. Music selections could be improved however."
"August 12, 2016","I love it. I make me a play list and Bluetooth it to my speakers and I'm rocking."
"August 24, 2017","Too money hungry nothing for the user"
"November 7, 2016","The music is of high quality and all new music are available."
"January 3, 2017","So far good. Haven't had the time for adding songs"
"January 12, 2017","Will not download properly cannot open it or videos"
"January 28, 2017","I love having to listen to what I prefer musically."
"June 18, 2017","Love the ad free music!"
"October 22, 2015","I enjoy having amazon music app.,can't lose my songs,if I lose my phone, I jus re-download all my new songs to the new phone I get,thankz Amazon,00)"
"September 21, 2012","The amazon music app is exactly what I was expecting pertaining to retrieving the music that I would like to listen and considering purchasing. I haven't really had any complaints about it and since I mainly have android devices I'm digging the cloud player that I can use for my purchases as well as the current content that is featured on each of my android devices."
"January 27, 2016","Excellent"
"May 17, 2016","I like it, but they do not have as much music to choose from as some of the other streaming services."
"May 17, 2016","Lots of music choices. Plus songs can be downloaded so you're not having to use Data while listening."
"November 15, 2016","Love all the songs I am able to hear again thank you Amazon"
"September 24, 2016","I LOVE Amazon Prime & I haven't even had time to use it to the fullest."
"September 6, 2016","Uninstalled, I dont like it to be always on, even if you restart the phone."
"November 21, 2015","I've enjoyed the music I've gotten. It sounds really good. But I am still trying to figure out how I can listen to my music when I'm offline."
"June 17, 2014","I haven't used this service much so my impressions are just prreliminary. The interface is not intutive and there doesn't seem to be much help. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I was unable to locate music that should have been obvious. The Beatles, Randy Newman, Joni Mitchell, etc. The music that seem to come up in the playlists is all new (2000 to now) stuff that I've never heard of. Not that I stay on top of modern music much (I'm 61). I might fool around with it some more to make sure I'm not doing something wrong but if I can't get the music I'm interested in I don't see the point. I already have Pandora and all my music library on my phone. I appreicate it that Amazon gave us Prime members something for free but for me the jury is still out on how much a benefit it will be."
"March 11, 2015","Without Chromecast support this is just another portion of amazon prime that locks you into buying Kindles and Fire TV. It's a lack of flexibility like this that has kept me away from Apple lately."
"March 4, 2016","love it. use it everyday. love that I can upload my own music, mix it with Prime music, and make playlists from both."
"August 21, 2015","love prime music"
"April 7, 2015","Amazon continues to surprise me with excellence. Amazon Prime Music is enriching each day with album listening that hasn't been so convenient and available. Worth the Prime membership itself."
"August 23, 2015","That was really cool... felt like I saved a half a tank of gas and I liked the price offered for my item I purchased... best of all it was there when I got home."
"January 4, 2015","the ""FREE"" choices are limited and not many i would like. when i signed up i thought it was more like netflicks or hulu big dissapointment one Cher album the rest are expensive and single songs 1.29"
"August 23, 2014","very clumsy to use. I was just trying the free trial and did no spend much time figuring out how to use it but didn't think I had to. downloaded music didn't play at our cabin where we have no internet connection. I will stay with sirius"
"August 1, 2015","I love this its way better than Pandora or anything else and best its free. I loved making my own playlist, its better than ITunes or anything else. Best of all in the car, no commercials or anything else like that. Make your own playlist and have a great time listening and accessing multiple albums."
"September 3, 2016","This part of Amazon Prime is the icing on the cake for my Prime Membership."
"July 30, 2016","Pretty good would give it 5 stars but didn't work on my phone at all only my tablet"

"July 30, 2017","Cost to much for music"
"April 9, 2013","Great selections! When searching for a song, you will usually find several versions that you can choose from whether they are studio versions, live versions or cover versions. Easy to operate as well. There are options to keep your purchase in the cloud and or download it to your computer. This is the only music service for me."
"October 26, 2015","So far I love it! I'm using it to assist my running routine. I love how I can download music to my device so I don't have to use my data! Love it!"
"July 25, 2016","I love that I can download free music to my phone to listen to without using my data"
"June 8, 2015","Very nice feature of amazon prime, one of the reasons in fact that I subscribed to it. It's very nice to able to listen to MOST new songs and ofcourse the quote unquote oldies."
"October 15, 2016","Looks easy but how do you pay and does it download to your device"
"April 30, 2016","It worked for a long time but now it won't even open. I've reported the problem several times and nothing has changed."

"May 19, 2016","Really like thst I can skip songs w/o a limit, I can like a song &/or add to a self named ply list."
"September 26, 2014","This app is awesome. .. but , it ask for to permissions that I don't think have nothing to do with me listening to music... it's my phone . I don't appreciate the unnecessary permissions. Other then that it would have 5 stars..."

"February 20, 2014","I used to have this app on my kindle fire hd and loved it. I want it on my HDX, but when I try to download it, I get an error message that it's not compatible. Anyone else have this problem? Anyone know a solution? Only have it one star because it won't let me download it!"
"October 17, 2016","No complaints. Works great! Another awesome prime perk"
"July 23, 2015","I love the fact that don't have interruption, Like comercials."
"January 31, 2016","It is really awesome to listen to a variety of stations with no interruptions. Great sound as well! Way to go Amazon prime."
"January 7, 2015","I like the addition of all the music through Prime membership. The app keeps it well organized with the ability to create play lists and groupings, as well as, downloading to my Kindle for use without wi-fi"
"February 4, 2016","Love it! Many stations to choice from. I also like the recommendations when you search or play I specific artist or album."
"March 30, 2015","Having Amazon music as a part of prime is a nice little perk. Lots of genres to choose from.."

"December 7, 2015","Great sound quality but limited choice. Definitely love offline mode with prime...great for travel. Great extra prime benefit for sure."
"February 2, 2015","I love my music, I love having prime music with Amazon, and I love this player! It is easy the use, easy to make playlist and very easy to add and delete songs from. Thank you Amazon for very nice app."
"July 15, 2014","how can we not love yet another free bonus from Amazon Prime? Sure there is some limitation to what music is available free, but then again, what IS available is FREE! Loved the Prime shipping discounts already- this is the icing on the cake."
"February 6, 2015","I have had Prime Music for2 months now I am very happy with it there is a great deal of music to, pick from,at first I was wondering if Prime was worth the dues but now I am very happy I purchased it."
"October 18, 2016","Updated and changed the color of the icon. Why do they do that?"
"April 6, 2015","I wanted to give it a try on my phone so I tried to download the app but it wanted to read all my personal data on my phone and could change or earase things from my memory card, no thanks!"
"October 27, 2014","Not able to select where you want the downloaded files. Currently files have to be save onto the device and not an expansion drive."
"August 10, 2015","better than iTunes. The playlist curators are excellent."
"March 2, 2016","I love this, the only critique I have is that theyes need more music! There are a few artists that u couldn't find."

"April 19, 2015","I use this all day at work, as well as my 80 commute to and from work. Always 2anted stations to be added to the mobile app. Now I can truly be happy with my unlimited 4G LTE internet!"
"December 28, 2014","This is a poor music site !! Downloading music through the site can be confusing needs a lot of work for Prime members the overall selection you have access to for free is mediocre, this is a disappointment."

"September 13, 2016","Good selection..easy to set up play list.good quality soundwith no lag"
"June 19, 2014","I loved the Amazon mp3 Player! Bit with each update it lost some of its appeal. Now it's totally lost it. And because I unknowingly installed the latest update, I now have Amazon Music. My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I've emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall yesterday. What a pain. I definitely don't want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebook knowing what I'm listening to. Who cares? And that's an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I don't like this and I'm very unhappy with it? I'm starting to like Walkman and Songza more and more."
"March 29, 2016","Excellent choice of music and love to plug my phone into my stereo and listen to the music of my choice! :-)"
"June 1, 2016","Great feature....I have an Amazon Echo and it is super as I am able to tailor my own playlists"

"January 24, 2017","The best music streaming out there, hands down."
"February 18, 2017","Still trying to see if it's worth the $100?????"
"June 27, 2014","the amount of albums and music available is great however I cannot use the app itself it will not authenticate my account. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it, did a force close & cleared cache too. Same issue with the Amazon App Store update."
"October 24, 2014","No stars. Cover bands in the style of??? Really ?? what a joke."
"December 18, 2014","Keeps randomly closing on my Nexus 7, making awkward silent moments during the lap dances at work. Also kept suggesting Mariah Carey when I had only downloaded a classical violin album and Alice Cooper so far."

"July 1, 2014","I like this app in general, it has some very nice features, however the performance of many of them has a lot of room for improvement. The app is pretty sluggish to respond to the commands. I'm hoping it will be improved in the later versions."
"March 13, 2016","Easy to find and stream the music I like. I can stream into Bluetooth earbuds or into my car speakers. Great."

"July 15, 2016","I like the Playlist. East app to navigate. Boom! I like it better than apple music."
"June 15, 2014","This application is fantastic. Not only does it ease the navigation of Prime music, it has a clean interface, and music plays from your library as if it were stored locally (broadband connection dependent, of course).  Well done Amazon!"
"May 11, 2016","Having android and comparing it to google music, I just found it not as easy to access and listen."
"April 11, 2015","The radio streaming doesn't seem to work on either of my Kindle's or my Samsung tab. Works great on the laptop, but I would rather be able to use the streaming on something more mobile."
"November 21, 2014","I love that its inclusive in the Prime package, and as the Library grows its getting better all the time. Granted there are some you still need to pay for, the amount included with the Prime package is pretty fair."
"March 3, 2016","Terrific selection. Easy, quick download. Just wish there were a bigger whole album selection of Christian music."

"June 8, 2016","I loved this app but where did it go"
"March 5, 2016","Love the different music choices. Very easy to navigate through and easy to stream for a very reasonable price."
"November 24, 2014","Rounded up from 2.5. Big frustration factor to find out how to use it, both on my desktop and Samsung S4 phone. Finally figured out ""most"" of the mystery though by ""swyping"" around the phone...... arrrrrg!"
"July 18, 2017","wish you had more songs but NICE"
"January 15, 2017","Not sure if it works better than Amazon Prime."

"May 16, 2016","Amazon Prime has all the music anyone could ever want. I do wish that the Downloads were faster."
"October 29, 2015","I find the interface convoluted, vague and confusing. Once I get a file selected to play then it is fine but the whole app should be revised."
"September 25, 2017","good"

"August 2, 2016","I find it easy to use and always find music that suits my mood. It's fabulous!"
"January 14, 2014","Huge selection. It is very easy to find anything you are looking for. Selecting by song, album, genre, etc. Never takes more than a few short seconds to find everything you are looking for. Most prices are lower than other places I've looked. Highly recommend you search here."
"January 15, 2013","The MP3 app is new to me and doesn't come with easy to use or understand instructions. I am looking for a replacement for Rhapsody where I can purchase my music and store in the Cloud and pay from anywhere. This app appears to fulfill those requirement; but the lack of simple instructions on how to use it is the reason for the low rating."
"February 10, 2016","Amazon Prime Music constantly crashes my android note 3 phone. The app is becoming more useless as each day passes by"
"March 3, 2016","I liked that i was offered to try this for free as a prime member. the music is great and a good selection."

"March 30, 2014","Getting this app on my new phone was a pain, I have to download another amazon app to get this app. Not a big deal but why not just allow the selection of an app and then just get that app instead of fishing and jumping through seemingly endless hoops to do so."
"September 12, 2016","Pretty good selection of music, rarely have any issues with the app."
"July 23, 2015","It works great, really enjoyed listening to music on prime"

"September 28, 2016","I never received the app on my two PCs, nor was it on my Kindle."
"December 12, 2015","More of today's songs available but good luck trying to find music from 30 or so years ago. Limited artists and songs in that era."
"August 28, 2016","I have only had it for a few days,so far so good, ask me in 3 months..."

"July 31, 2015","It's fantastic  Oldies but goodies are my favorite"
"July 27, 2014","Downloaded to my Galaxy tablet so I could play my Amazon Prime music while practicing bass guitar. Easy download on tablet, directly connects to Amazon Prime Music files (which cannot be downloaded to your PC), and works as advertised."
"July 9, 2016","I wish the search features were better but the range of music offered is extensive"
"July 9, 2013","I downloaded this app and purchased a couple of songs and walla! Much to my happy surprise, Amazon put an album on the player that I had purchased from them in 2007.

"July 23, 2016","Good. But dont have all music in an artist listing, some you have to purchase."
"September 15, 2015","Best music streaming service ever! Love it!! Will highly recommend!!! A+++++"
"August 3, 2015","A little buggy when trying to play a second playlist."
"December 2, 2016","Amazon Music started out crisp and useful but in this latest iteration has become clunky and overloaded with a significant loss of utility. I miss the old interface and functionality."
"May 2, 2015","I actually have used this and the downloads are fast and easy I was truelly amazed there was how many songs, albums, artist prime music offers and its lightning quick downloading"
"April 30, 2016","Great perk from Amazon Prime. Just wish they had it for smart tv's , blue ray players, xbox, etc."
"September 21, 2016","You it.... easy to use.... works on my PC , phone, firestick...."
"March 25, 2015","My prime library search bar has a drop down menu to search by genre or mood. It was stuck on jazz. A data reset of the app now has it stuck on all moods and genres. Galaxy S5 Lolollipop."
"June 30, 2016","Lots of music to choose from and the price is right. A great alternative to itunes."
"July 22, 2015","Love, love, love the offline access to downloaded songs."
"December 30, 2015","This has got to be one of the best perks of the PRIME membership. Awesome way to enjoy all favorite tunes from then and now."
"January 12, 2016","Wow! What a great selection of great music! I think Prime is a great investment for music, shipping, movies, the works!"
"December 6, 2016","The concept is buying songs you like, not necessarily purchasing the entire album. Cost-effective and legal approach to getting the tracks you love. Lets you sample the song first to help you decide whether to purchase or not. Once purchased, you can download to your personal playlist. The fun part? Most of the songs which originally appeared in cassette tape format are available. Talk about a treasure trove of old and new tracks!"
"January 9, 2017","don't download much.. music isn't my thing."
"December 20, 2016","Awesome selection and very easy to use app."
"January 20, 2017","Works well. Still getting familiar with it."
"September 15, 2016","It would be great if I could save a list of my favorite stations."
"July 5, 2015","I am constantly amazed at the quality of the music available on PRIME! Sure is worth the money and I would spend hundreds of dollars on the albums I like otherwise."
"June 28, 2016","Still a few bugs (screens hang, music stops playing) but other than that I love it."
"April 19, 2016","Don't have a lot of newer album/songs. Selection pretty sparse compared to other streaming service."
"April 6, 2016","By far the best music app. Customizable and Great download offline options. Another hit Amazon. Kudos!"
"June 20, 2015","Good selection"
"July 24, 2015","Im feeling the music i just have to download more of it"
"May 3, 2015","Not sure why I didn't download this sooner! I love all of the music choices, the playlists, the channels. I can listen to it at work or through my Echo at home and it's amazing!"
"January 23, 2016","Great for finding music missing from my collection, and nice for streaming new to to hear what's out there. Great app!"
"July 14, 2016","Love that I can download on my prime account so many of my favorite songs free."
"January 24, 2016","I can now listen to all of my favorite artist"
"June 22, 2015","No complaints, I use Amazon Prime Music very frequently. It uses less data than many music apps (since the screen still is allowed to sleep and no videos are playing."
"August 20, 2015","Needs more songs and more of a genre selection."
"August 29, 2015","Great app! The playlists come in very handy!! I have been able to find every artist I have searched for, which is rare.... If only it worked on roku..."
"January 17, 2016","Love this app and Amazon. Great selection of free songs plus any you want to buy. Love the offline library option also."
"October 30, 2015","This is app has real issues offline stream still looks for connection and gets stuck con loading....one needs to turn off connections. .."
"July 24, 2015","LOVE LOVE LOVE AMAZON PRIME MUSIC! Before I had iheart and Pandora... for me THIS IS BETTER. No ads!! I love too how know I can get it on my Amazon Fire Stick."
"October 12, 2016","Good layout and easy to use. Playlists could be expanded."
"October 20, 2017","It does everything it should"
"December 4, 2015","Not user-friendly format and tends to have the worst albums of good artists. If this was the only prime benefit, Ii would cancel."
"January 12, 2017","Awesome.... Think It, But It, Download it."
"December 25, 2016","Great sound... Nerd more music bit crear!!"

"December 24, 2016","I listen to Amazon music nearly every day!"
"December 1, 2014","I am listening to my lengthy Christmas playlist on my bose from cloud then bluetooth from my tablet as I write, and it's great. All my music from the cloud is a year round experience I'm looking forward to."

"December 18, 2016","One of the perks to Amazon Prime! Love it!"
"August 10, 2015","excelete product loved the article I congratulate"
"July 1, 2016","I didn't really enjoy it. It's just sample tracks. Pandora I feel is much better."
"March 11, 2015","I think the website is misleading, especially when they offer so many versions of songs but not by the original performer. I can see how you can waste a lot of money if you're not sharp."
"July 7, 2015","I've been a Pandora person for years but I'm really liking the Amazon Prime Music. It's easy to use and has a lot of options that Pandora didn't. It's a keeper."
"July 26, 2016","Use it all of the time and they have a pretty good selection of free music."
"October 4, 2015","This app does not work well to play music. I do not like it putting my other downloads on this app. I only want it to work with Amazons music."
"September 21, 2016","Simple and easy to use. Nice variety, something for everyone."
"July 31, 2016","Was able to download it to my phone directly. Helped me to play it offline"
"July 22, 2016","love this new benefit for the prime member very easy to use love it!!!!!!!!!"
"August 20, 2015","It is great, but I ordered a number of songs that I can't retrieve from my cloud any longer, when I had to have my phone repaired, so went all my music."
"March 30, 2015","I don't like that i have to download everything through the special Amazon App store."
"April 7, 2015","Great service with an amazing selection of music including some hard to find artists. Some of the play lists are a but on the short side but a really nice selection. Worth the time."
"August 7, 2017","Streams perfectly. Good variety of music."
"December 26, 2016","Love ! Love ! Love it ! Great streaming !"
"January 7, 2017","love this app very simple and easy to use"
"September 24, 2016","I use this for sleepy time music to help put my son to sleep!"
"July 16, 2016","Useful and has much of the music I want, available almost anywhere , anytime."
"August 8, 2015","Good app for PC it work well! An easy to yes too!"
"July 18, 2015","I won't finish the install after I saw all the things I had to allow the app access to. Too many permissions I'm not willing to grant. I'll stick with spotify."
"August 6, 2016","Love having access to so many of my favorite music...please add more! :)"
"October 21, 2012","Purchased a couple of MP3 songs from Amazon and apparently they must be downloaded to the Cloud. I purchased the songs and feel that I should be able to put them anywhere I want. I have not found how to move the files out of the cloud and put them on Windows Media Player or whatever. Don't need some other file to cluter up my music."
"May 28, 2016","I like the product because it allows me to listen to my downloaded music in good quality"
"October 2, 2016","I think it's a pretty good app to check out new artists on."
"December 6, 2015","I get all the newest songs to listen to without the commercials. I have also been able to customize my own Playlist. Love it!"
"October 29, 2015","The app is constantly stopping midsong and then freezes up. Worked great the first couple of months but after an update became worthless."
"December 9, 2016","Too complicated. I cannot figure it out )-:"
"January 27, 2016","Started listening since this service is included w prime membership. The selections & playlists are comprehensive."
"July 14, 2016","Beats all the competition!!! Out there in first place and will stay a winner."
"April 26, 2016","I wish it gave a video tutorial on how ro use it,other than that i very happy with yhe service."
"August 7, 2015","I can't tell which Amazon service rocks the most!"
"September 3, 2015","So far so good, there are a few artist who I would like to see more material from but there is so much other stuff that is good. I am happy with it!"
"October 9, 2015","I love the fact that i can choose what i want to listen to an when. Amazon music with Prime is amazing. Only music app you will ever need!!"
"April 26, 2016","I can always get the latest music and even older hits that I can't find on any other music app."
"September 17, 2016","Never been let down. Quick service and great quality products."
"August 9, 2012","mp3 uploads from my PC take a while, but this app works really well. I use it mainly on a motorcycle via bluetooth into my helmet speakers, so not always with the strongest cell signal and never wifi. Amazon mp3 app stays connected more than any other internet music site, and reconnects the most when going in and out of service areas like on mountain roads."
"May 13, 2016","I love that Amazon Prime with music has playlists and different stations...plus NO ADS!!!!!"
"September 26, 2016","Love using this, able to bring up music suited to our taste."
"February 26, 2016","Very easy to customize stations and add new songs directly to your phone so you can have it anywhere you go!"
"August 19, 2014","After the last update or two to this app, my phone has been so unresponsive - slow to launch apps, slow within apps, slow to bring up keyboard, etc. Always a delay, sometime for several seconds for what used to be almost instant. Then today, while in an unrelated app, ""Amazon Music"" popped up for several seconds, then disappeared with a crash message. I rarely use Amazon Music, and hadn't even launched it for a few months, so I uninstalled it.  If your phone has gotten very slow the last month or two, and you have Amazon Music, try uninstalling it. My phone is back to normal. I'm running Android 4.2.2 (Jellybean)."
"September 8, 2016","Love this. Having my music wherever i go is awesome. Great app.."
"October 21, 2016","No ads, easy to use, and choice of stations/playlists."
"April 7, 2015","hi output program. So now it's time to convert those iTunes files into simple mp3. Great for Bluetooth speakers with low output. And you can't beat the price or the sound... Really"
"September 20, 2016","Loved this on the PC, not so much on the cell phone or tablet"
"August 28, 2015","No easy way to upload my music to cloud. Mobile app is not user friendly interface because there us no way to change to a default setting to artists."
"August 28, 2015","For some reason I was not able to download songs through Amazon like I used to. It would accept pay source but no problems with all my other orders!"
"January 11, 2017","Can always find d something to listen to"
"December 21, 2016","A great way to listen and download music"
"August 11, 2017","Easy to use lots of music to choose from"
"January 9, 2017","Great variety of music, easy to use app."
"February 9, 2017","It was adequate to my needs at the time."
"August 5, 2015","Amazon, thanks so much. I am enjoying this a lot!"
"August 7, 2017","It's GREAT!!"
"September 28, 2016","I've the ease of use and large selection of music. Thanks."
"September 19, 2014","Yet another benifit of Amazon Prime. Tons of free songs and playlists. The App itself is easy to navigate and the music control buttons are always on the bottom so you can play and skip songs all while browsing for more."
"November 2, 2016","I like the multiple variety that it has to offer..."
"October 2, 2016","I like the broad music library and ease of using the site."
"December 7, 2015","The app works great most of the time, but occasionally it will have some responsiveness issues, but that may just be my phone."
"December 7, 2015","still getting used to it after switching from google music. I think it will be just as good. I love that they put the lyrics"
"November 15, 2016","Lovely addition to prime way better than Pandora"
"October 28, 2016","I love Amazon Music. Just added it to my new laptop."
"March 2, 2016","Sometimes when I start it up it kinda bugs out, but overall this here feels something like fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
"May 21, 2017","The last 2 updates have absolutely ruined Amazon music. I love Amazon but they are now trying to force users into purchasing Amazon Unlimited for 9.99 a month. Nope. I pay for Prime. This app is now horrible to navigate and nearly impossible to purchase music. At every selection, you are promoted to try Unlimited for 30 days free. Greedy Amazon. Bad form."
"December 22, 2015","Too many glitches AND charges me for music that is supposed to be on Amazon Prime then Amazon refuses to refund the money!"
"December 17, 2016","Two thumbs up. Love the artist stations."
"October 4, 2013","I have long preferred Amazon to iTunes for buying mp3 primarily for the selection but also the prices. Having an easy and convenient way to access my collection on my Android devices has made switching devices so much easier. Every time I think I have a complaint, I find a way around it."
"May 10, 2015","The system works fine, but searching overall library on my S3 is kinda cumbersome. I will state i am new to this app.......and will post an updated review after further use"
"February 8, 2016","I use this as my only music player. I think there's still work to be done on the organization of the interface."
"November 11, 2016","Amazon music and prime is perfect match for me.."
"June 22, 2014","Its not very smooth as in song choosing/playing. Kind of a bit more of a task to get it going then other music players of this type. Also if your on the prime music membership program, not all songs are available free. Lame if you ask me"
"August 10, 2017","Spotify is easier to use."
"November 2, 2016","Great so far. Better than all the other music apps"
"January 10, 2017","Commercial free! Easy to choose genre."
"January 30, 2017","Don't have all the songs you search for"
"January 5, 2017","Love it! Great perk with Amazon Prime."
"July 19, 2017","Great Buy!!"
"August 10, 2017","Works great"
"July 18, 2015","I can't register my account and credit card because the USA is not listed as an option when entering my address. I bought the mp3 and can't listen to it now."
"April 19, 2016","Used the wedding album music, it was awesome and went off without a hitch. Thanks Amazon Prime"
"October 24, 2015","This was the most confusing experience in trying to gain access to an app that I have ever gone through. Do not recommend this at all."
"December 2, 2015","Downloaded but didn't install. This app wanted access permission to too many areas and data on my phone which isn't necessary."
"May 19, 2016","Great music! Amazon poems music even consists of newer Songs and albums! Very satisfied"
"September 2, 2014","I've not had any problems except when doing multiple downloads. The ability to have almost any song you can think of or any artist is really nice. This is just another great benefit of being a prime member.Thanks Amazon!!!"
"January 19, 2014","we have tablets for the kids, and us. we also have a home computer and two smartphones. this app allows us to use the cloud to move all the music we bought to all of our devices. each person can choose the individual songs they want downloaded to there own device."
"September 23, 2016","First time using Prime and the Music feature - its AWESOME."
"June 17, 2015","it no longer receives updates on my nvidia sheild hand held and even on my htc 8 which still gets updates it crashes after about 3 sounds on my downloaded playlist"
"August 9, 2014","This App is still in the Stone Age. Cannot download to SD storage. Sure, you can play from the Cloud but there go all your minutes!"
"August 10, 2015","A great new addition to Amazon Prime benefits."
"November 16, 2016","Great selection and downloadable to the device"
"February 17, 2016","The app constantly stop working. It is very annoying. There are far better working music app out on the web."
"August 5, 2015","This is great! I joined Prime last Christmas when I was doing my Christmas shopping to get the free shipping on a number of items. I month later I got the bill for $99.00 for a year. I thought OUCH! Then I started looking into it. I was able to create play lists of my favorite music on my lap top and, after downloading the app, onto my cell-phone. I was able to log into Amazon Prime at work and play my type music for free on my work computer. At work I have no CD/DVD drive at work, this makes it difficult to listen to my kind of music to be more productive. I haven't really even started with the videos."
"October 7, 2015","A nice subscription music program but I love in the country and not being to play offline is a deal breaker. Not a huge fan of data music."
"October 29, 2015","I love having access to FREE music and not having to listen to other music in the meantime. I have a full stream of all my favorites."
"January 2, 2017","Possibly the best music app I've used."
"February 1, 2017","hard to navigate to ""stations"""
"December 24, 2014","hard to use. seems to want to sell music, rather than play it. Cant' use the playlists from Prime with Sonos--can't figure out why. Way too complicated for well educated, techno-savvy users even!"
"June 19, 2017","Good stuff"
"April 15, 2017","I Love It!"
"September 7, 2017","No comment"
"January 5, 2013","Makes handling my Amazon music a breeze. Where I live downloading is a tedious slow process, but I recently got my broadband connection and my own wifi and life is wonderful. I got one of those lovely collections of 99 and it did it's thing without me having to monitor the process all day! Yay for Amazon MP3 and the Amazon Cloud."
"April 29, 2015","Nice selection of music and great the fact that is commercial free...."
"August 20, 2016","i have listed all the songs i like listening to an so easy to use!"
"November 19, 2016","Fantastic! I have prime and this works great."
"April 19, 2016","I like this app alot. It has better music then most of the other music apps. And more updated."
"January 6, 2016","Replaced my Pandora radio. Download songs and can be used as ringtones. For the best expirence you need amazon prime."
"December 27, 2014","Absolutely no complaints. So many music choices, so little time(sigh). Streaming is seamless. Downloading is simple. Prices are reasonable. Goodbye Google Play Music. Hello Amazon Music with Prime."
"May 30, 2015","We put this app our new Moto g phone just so we could sit on the deck and listen to music. We love it. Lots and lots of playlists of defferent types of music. Fun!"
"November 5, 2015","I love this even more than Pandora. It rarely has buffering issues and it has no commercials and it plays a great variety of songs!"
"May 14, 2016","Easy to use. Make a wide variety of music available at an affordable price. Works well."
"August 27, 2016","East to use....love it! All my favorite music at me fingertips."
"March 20, 2017","PANDORA"
"October 9, 2017","Never worked"
"August 16, 2015","Just getting started. Like it so far. Will continue to expand & make this my primary music source.  Easy to use & play on multiple devices."
"July 22, 2016","One of the major benefits of Amazon Prime membership. Absolutely great!"
"February 4, 2016","wasn't to crazy about it, put in salsa per willie colon gave me linda ronstad ( unsure of spelling) not cool."
"July 26, 2016","I choose what I want and get it instead of a lot of stuff I don't want."
"March 19, 2015","Get spotify. Just, get spotify. Prime Music has some serious growing it needs to do before I will use or recommend. Its just that it has 5% of the available music that Spotify does."
"May 12, 2016","I have found almost every song I've looked for in Prime Music. I have really enjoyed it."
"March 27, 2015","I've been a prime member for years. Im paid up for the next year. The app does not have a prime search, nor indicates any song as prime. Does not meet its advertised attribute."
"November 2, 2015","Still working on how to best use this. Everything is there and it seems easy. I do not use it much, so I have basic programming on."
"January 31, 2017","This is my go to streaming music app."
"September 5, 2017","I can listen to what I want. Love it."
"January 16, 2017","Great music, it has replaced my iPod."
"June 19, 2017","I love it"
"May 29, 2017","worth it!"
"October 15, 2015","Without Amazon Music Importer, Amazon Music with Prime Music is just another music software program with some songs available for free."
"August 9, 2015","Selection of music is okay, but the policy that a household member (not the original prime member) can not use the service doesn't make lot of sense."
"August 27, 2015","I think this is s great service. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because a couple of artists/albums I searched for weren't available."
"November 6, 2016","Like it but have a hard time finding some music"
"April 7, 2011","Love this app. First Player & cloud service worth my time.  I do get some weird updating warnings, since this app can't be uninstalled from the Android Market 1st, as it is a system application, before installing the Amazon Appstore version. Original Droid (Froyo) & Xoom (Honeycomb)."
"July 31, 2015","Works extremely well. Great seleection of music"
"July 28, 2016","I SEEM TO be able to work this site and they have all the music I love"
"February 3, 2015","This is now my go-to music app. Has all of my Amazon prime music (which can be DLed for use offline!), and manages my mp3s that are loaded as well. Better than Google's music app, to me."
"October 9, 2016","Love i . Has just about everything I'm looking for!!!"
"September 7, 2015","Average at best. The Prime Stations are difficult to turn off. It seems it has to be paused and then delete it with the phone's task manager."
"August 20, 2015","Still limited.. hope they add more to it."
"November 2, 2014","The app use to crash occasionally, but now the app crashes every time I open it, thus it's useless. Please update!"
"October 7, 2015","THIS Is AWESOME. I used to listen to the radio but not much any more but now I can have my music with me at all times. Love it. Thanks"
"November 20, 2014","Great Music, but need to have more artists on Prime that are free. Amazon Prime should also allow more than 1 person to be using it at a time, as my wife & I have to take turns listening on our devices."
"October 2, 2015","Ever since i started using amazon prime im very excited with all this great music ..definitely passing the word on to friends and family"
"November 7, 2016","I only listen to music on this app. Its great!"
"May 4, 2017","I love my song choices"
"March 9, 2016","Love Amazon prime music. Can listen through my computer or any of my devices. Dancing all day long."
"January 31, 2017","Love the selection and so easy touse"
"September 27, 2017","This app will not work on my Kindle."
"May 24, 2017","Love it!"
"September 24, 2016","Love it, no matter what device I'm on my music is there."
"February 21, 2015","UI is very confusing and poorly laid out! Needs a drastic improvement. Song library is pale in comparison to the major apps... Pandora, slacker, spotify. Hopefull it will get better."
"June 20, 2014","It is supposed to be Android compatible but it doesn't work on my phone. I'll admit I have an older phone 2-3 year old HTC Thunderbolt running Cyanogenmod 7.1.1 and it loaded Amazon MP3 player instead. So I cannot use this app at all."
"July 9, 2014","I like this app for the most part.I have used the PC version for Windows, the iPad app, and the Android app for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Over all it performs well enough, but i do have a few gripes about it.  First complaint is where is the version for the Fire TV? I'm using the app on an Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft device, but Amazon hasn't got a version yet for their own device?? I keep hearing soon, but soon is never soon enough!  My next complaint is with editing songs/albums you have uploaded to the cloud. As with the Amazon MP3 app that this app replaced there is no way to edit album art. I have over 15,000 songs uploaded to the Amazon Cloud Player and a number of them don't have the correct album cover art. Some have no album art at all even though all my songs/albums have a high quality image embedded in the MP3 file itself. If the mobile apps can't do this so be it, but you should at least be able to copy/paste your own album art on a PC or Mac similar to Google Play Music , iTunes, etc.  I also cant seem to stream any music via 3G/4G without constant buffering, so i have to make sure I remember to download music via Wi-Fi before leaving the house. I don't believe this is a limitation of the app, but has more to do with my cell carrier (Sprint) in my area. I also can't stream from Spotify either so it's more of a network issue.  I also don't like the fact that you have to add anything you want to play for the Prime Music selection to your library before you can play it. I use services like Spotify, Slacker, and Amazon Music to discover bands as well as play music I already know, so I don't want to add music to my library that I might not even like. We should be able to play the music and then add to our personal library if it turns out you like it.  Otherwise I think its a good app with much potential. The GUI is nice enough and easy to use. I expect Amazon, with their deep pockets, to sign more music labels and make more music available for Prime members in the future, but the selection isn't bad considering Prime Music just launched about 3 weeks ago. Still has a ways to go to reach Spotify's catalog of songs/artists/albums."

"November 18, 2014","Wouldn't want to be without it!!!! This app is the greatest of all the ones I own. It represents the quality and integrity of the company AMAZON. Jeff Besos had done a wonderful job in the implementation of this app and I don't think there is a more qualified person than him in running a HUGE ENTERPRISE like Amazon. He is truly to be commended for outstanding service ALL the time to each and every customer. I for one am very grateful!!!  Being a Prime Member is my pleasure and enjoyment."
"February 9, 2017","all the songs we like to listen too"
"February 3, 2017","Good selection of preferable music."
"December 22, 2016","Great just learning how to work it."

"May 29, 2017","Love it"
"October 1, 2014","Not sure what's happening with this app? I used the older version with no problem, but since Amazon added the Prime music, which is at times a hard to navigate and a real pain. The app is just not that great"
"December 15, 2016","Awesome, updated, and great choices."
"April 3, 2017","I love Amazon. I love Amazon music. I only want to buy my music from Amazon. I'd love to be able to play my Amazon music with my Amazon music app. But it sucks. I start it, it just shuts down. I start it again, get my band picked (on Prime, or my library) shuts down again.  Since I've had the app, I spent a lot of time setting my playlists. Then you update and bam, playlists are empty. I've done that multiple times. If you all don't do something I'm going to migrate to a different company. I don't want to, but as another reviewer said, you have to try hard to make an app this bad."
"September 19, 2016","A bit difficult to get used to but all in all a nice app"
"August 28, 2016","The offline downloads disappear. Everything is not available."
"December 2, 2015","I'm still learning how to work the app but overall it seems pretty great - just need to keep increasing the music catalog!"
"August 1, 2015","I like it so far.... I have just got on it..."
"February 20, 2015","Amazing quality, tons of tunes. I create my own playlists... I would like to have some of the music available of line similar to other services. But when I have connection it is great!"
"October 28, 2014","not compatible with kindle fire"
"December 10, 2016","As a prime member this is a nice perk"
"June 21, 2016","I just started using because it was in my Prime membership. So, why not - right?  It surprised me in a good way! The app has been updated, so it runs pretty smoothly in Android. It has a decent quality in streaming, but I recommend downloading and playing offline your favorite music. The audio quality will be top!  The desktop app is basically Spotify with an Amazon skin. So, you know what to expect.  Unfortunately, my cars don't have a link to this app, so I only have basic controls over Bluetooth - which is not bad at least, but not perfect. However, nothing that makes me stop using it.  If you're Prime, this is a must use!"
"December 6, 2014","I have several music apps on my phone but Amazon music is the only one that gets used. It is so convenient and the playlists have music I actually want to hear. Great value with my prime membership."
"July 23, 2016","I haven't had a lit of time to try it out but I really like it so far"
"July 24, 2015","This is what makes paying for prime worth it!!!"
"December 1, 2015","Great app. I think the widget could be a little bigger, but other than that I think it's pretty great to have on my phone."
"May 19, 2012","it will purchase and install, that is about all this app will do for my SGSII Skyrocket... on first load from the install screen it complains that my keyboard is not in English (it is, I have checked and can't type any other language). After that it won't launch. ""Requested action could not be completed."". Did not look for a solution beyond uninstalling."
"July 17, 2014","It might just be me but I find this app confusing. I have problems organizing my lists and I can't figure out how to get rid of music I downloaded and decided I don't want. It is functional though and I will continue to use it."
"November 30, 2016","Awesome you can hear anything you want"
"July 2, 2014","library takes 10 minutes to display newly added content, limited selection, interface could use some tweaking. as an extra option to my prime membership it's OK but I wouldn't pay extra for it. I have way more options with spotify"
"February 6, 2015","Music is fine, but wish I could turn my TV off to listen to the music on my stereo receiver. Seems like leaving the expensive TV on for hours just to listen to music isn't a good idea."
"July 24, 2015","Great. Variety and easy to navigate through it"
"June 27, 2015","nice offering compared to Pandora or other competitors. I do like the commercial free part. The stations are nice. Haven't tried the playlist feature yet."
"August 6, 2015","Very easy to use, great selection of music."
"January 2, 2015","I am so very happy to have this service---listen to music I want, radio choice with many genre---have used through computer and kindle fire ---makes amazon Prime definately worth the money !!!"
"April 29, 2015","I cant tell you how happy I am to have this music at my fingertips, whenever and wherever I happen to be, it has been a godsend, making my workouts east peasy. Thank You"
"February 3, 2016","Used the One Republic station and loved it. Music was varied and came through clear on my speaker. Great!"
"June 20, 2014","Was expecting to be an advanced type of pandora music player but seemed like its all about selling music that i could just use itunes for anyways but im still new to amazon music so maybe i just dont know how to use it properly yet."
"January 20, 2016","Needs some fixing. Has a weird interference sound that is pretty creepy at times. Also slow to load. It's okay"
"October 15, 2015","I think it so awesome that we can download just about any type or taste in music! I love Prime and the selections are worth noting!"
"May 14, 2017","Best music app ever!"
"September 9, 2017","I love Amazon music!"

"February 27, 2016","I have to admit there is a lot of music to choose from, I love this, so far my music is non stop lol"
"September 5, 2014","We really enjoy this service. Not only do they have a lot of good music, they have created playlists sometimes by artist and sometimes by genre and those are great. We love the ones that are ""kids friendly""."
"February 10, 2017","Amazon music rocks and the best!!!"
"October 27, 2016","Good alternative to radio stations especially if you do not want to deal with ads. Prime members should take advantage of the free music streaming that Amazon provides! I haven't yet streamed music with the Amazon Music app without wifi yet, but so far it has been relatively smooth and the audio is high quality. The only downside is that it seems you would have to choose another playlist once the current one is finished, or else the music just stops. It is only a drawback because I like to listen to music for long periods of time and it is a bit bothersome to constantly pick another playlist once one is over."
"November 25, 2015","Working pretty good...... Missing a lot of music compared to other services... But being part of Prime this can't be beat."
"March 27, 2015","I love this feature. I have access to many different songsand can make my own play lists. I love having access to the free songs and being able to search different play lists."
"April 15, 2015","Get almost everything you want. Albums, songs, Lyrics to sing to. (plus you can touch a lyric you may have not nailed at that moment and back up the song to sing it again)"
"December 4, 2016","Love this have it on all my devices.."
"August 30, 2016","I love the music right at your fingertips. So many choices!"
"July 26, 2016","Love having the different types of music to listen to while I work."
"May 8, 2015","The fact that Amazon has ADDED this feature at no extra charge for my Prime Subscription is awesome! They now added more value to an already great service. Thank you."
"November 13, 2012","I am unable to download to my xoom wifi. I get an error message that says ""retry when connected to internet"". I am connected with full bars. Any help?"
"October 3, 2016","Just started using it so far is good no complaints."
"October 23, 2017","Love the selections"
"December 26, 2016","Cost is too high for cloud upload"
"December 24, 2016","easy to use and loaded with music"
"November 19, 2016","Glichie. I wish it worked better."
"December 21, 2016","Its not for metal thats for sure."
"February 8, 2017","I have used it daily on my phone."
"January 9, 2017","Easy to use and commercial Freeee"
"February 9, 2017","Trouble streaming through my Fire"
"February 20, 2016","Very invasive! This product continually restarts itself and runs in the background. I uninstalled it."
"November 28, 2015","I love being able to access my music on my computer and cell phone without having to copy the music to the second device."
"May 16, 2016","I love this app, great variety and no commercials like pandora or other music apps."
"August 4, 2014","Apparently I am unable to download the correct version of this app. I've tried three times and can never get the ""orange"" app. I always get the (green) mp3 version. So I can not listen to the ""free music"" that my prime membership supposedly affords me. It is not available. So I can't really reveiw this version. I can tell you that the mp3 version will not let me download music files nor can I access the cloud where I supposedly have music that I have placed in my library.  The whole thing is..."
"April 19, 2016","Hard to use interface for searching for tunes, and collection seems to be lamely curated."
"January 19, 2016","I find it confusing at times. It sometimes takes a while for me to get to the music i want. Could be just me."
"May 2, 2016","This is a great app. It's my go to app for all my music. I don't have any complaints."
"July 15, 2016","Cant believe I hadnt been using this feature from Prime. Its Amazing."
"April 8, 2015","Not very user friendly. But I called Amazon and customer service was so helpful! Now I can use it no problem. I'd give it 5 stars if I didn't have to call customer service."
"August 15, 2016","I've been very pleased with the Amazon Prime Music experience."
"December 14, 2016","Great , any music you might choose"
"May 30, 2017","As a Prime member, I downloaded this Amazon Music app to my Galaxy many months ago and then never looked at it. I looked at it today because I'll be on a 10-hr flight this summer (each way) and I need music to listen to OFF-LINE so I don't die from boredom. Whoppie! This is awesome! I'm downloading whole albums of Blues, Jazz, and whatever else I want for free. I was upset last year to learn that I could only download music I PURCHASED on Amazon to my computer, but the reason I wanted to do that is so I could put the music on phone. This is soooo much easier. Thank you, Amazon Prime!"
"July 2, 2014","It is very much improved. I would almost replace Pandora but, I can't save the Playlist or albums to the SD card and I can quickly run out of space on the internal memory. It would great 5 stars if I could save to the SD Memory"
"March 29, 2016","I love Amazon music!! I have found songs that I forgot remastered. And it's free with prime!!"
"September 18, 2016","Really enjoy hearing entire albums, not just the hits."
"August 10, 2016","Wide variety of music and can add from your personal collection"
"November 17, 2014","Not very useful, does not work or compatible on all of the Amazon devices. Kind of strange Amazon would develop something that does not work on all of their devices. But this is what I have come to expect."
"September 21, 2013","Recent changes in the app make it nearly unusable. It used to show how much of a song from my cloud player was downloaded so to avoid buffering issues I could pause the song until 1/4 or so was downloaded then begin playing. Now with no download status it's just blind guessing. Additionally, I can no longer skip back a small amount to listen to part of the song again. When I try now, it skips back to the beginning of the song so I have to listen to the whole song again. It's like a super cheap MP3 player. I pay for cloud storage to listen to songs on the go, but the app now makes it difficult."
"January 31, 2016","Love this app. I can have all of my Amazon paid and Prime music right on my phone, including my playlists."
"December 15, 2014","this is worth it and since I am unemployed it is one of the things I will keep as it is less than 10 a month for Prime and I read and watch the movies and at times listen all night to the music."
"September 25, 2015","I've had Amazon Prime for 2 years and just started listening to the music there. It is quickly replacing Pandora for me. Like it a lot!"
"January 31, 2016","Thoroughly enjoying the tremendous variety of artists, songs, and playlists available through Prime Music!"
"July 18, 2016","Love it. Sad thing is I had it for so long didn't even know about it"
"September 17, 2016","Didn't have full songs, just previews on some musicals"
"July 20, 2015","Love, love, love it. It makes my heart happy!"
"November 23, 2015","I like it"
"August 24, 2015","I have 2 accounts and it will not alow me to access the second one. PS they are on two different e mail address and password. Help me. ."
"November 4, 2016","It is awesome to listen to music on Amazon!"
"September 7, 2014","The music selection is good, but this app has a number of serious flaws. 1) no landscape mode any more (why take that away?!) 2) can't choose a path to save music 3) doesn't work with the equalizer on my tablet"
"May 14, 2016","I love it!!!"

"July 30, 2015","great selection of music. Easy to use app."
"October 11, 2015","I love being able to listen to great songs when I want to. Only problem is I really don't understand everything I can do with it."
"July 14, 2015","Great app. Easy to use, and it means that I'm able to all my music on all my devices without using up any memory space(apart from the original source)"
"October 29, 2015","stop using it on mobile. It mostly 60's-90's channels, not much free contemporary selection. REALLY high data usage on mobile."
"September 25, 2016","Love having all my music online using this service."
"May 31, 2015","This really isn't a very good music app. My expectations for Amazon were way higher than this app. Not at all what I've come to expect from Amazon. Needs work."
"December 12, 2016","Very user-friendly and enjoyable."

"August 1, 2016","Nice music app, I love that it comes with my prime membership."
"October 1, 2015","i have downgraded my review of this app. first pro is that you can download music for offline play. if you have an android device (for example my galaxy tab A) you can put that downloaded music onto the ext card. pro: i love the curated playlists that amazon creates. now the con which knock off 2 stars - IT IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING & CONFUSING APP I HAVE EVER EVER ENCOUNTERED. once you add an album or playlist to your library GOOD LUCK IN FINDING IT LATER. if you add more than one album it adds them all in a row of songs instead of individual albums - AGAIN SO FRUSTRATING AND CONFUSING. many times i get so frustrated that i just into recents and play that. why does it have to be the opposite of user friendly?"
"September 18, 2016","We like the song variety included with Prime Music."

"June 23, 2014","Great mixture of genres available for Prime Music. Need more music especially older titles from the 50s, 60s, 70, 80s, 90s. NIce arrangement of menus. Easily accessible. Love the new stand alone app for Amazon Prime Music."
"October 15, 2015","I have not used it a lot. Just signed up for the app last week. Downloaded a couple of albums quickly and easily. So far, so good."
"April 25, 2016","Very intrusive program! Now, I can't delete it, only disable it. IMHO, it's Spyware!"
"February 3, 2016","I love listening to Amazon Prime music while I'm doing my cmptr. work, fixing supper and doing dishes."
"November 11, 2015","Had to download this to be able to download music on my android phone. Worked great. I have an apple now so don't use it."
"November 12, 2016","Not as much of a selection as I'd like"
"July 17, 2016","Good music. Waiting to get Echo for even better music enjoyment."
"October 15, 2015","I use it everyday. Not every song/artist I want is available for free, but there's so many that are, I have plenty of choices."
"March 13, 2014","I've spent a lot of money on iTunes but it's annoying that I have to convert my music to Mp3 all the time. Not with Amazon MP3. And the prices are usually better than iTunes. I also love that my music is in the cloud and I can access it anywhere."
"June 12, 2014","I've enjoyed this app for a few years. That all stopped with the last update. Suddenly there are ads for amazon prime bs every time I go into the player. It's much slower and just a hassle to get around. Very poorly done amazon."
"September 16, 2016","How great of a collection to Listen to all generes."
"August 14, 2015","You prime account on note 3 will not work. I keep telling you this and Hotmail isn't I have one email jamesdept7@yahoo.com repeatedly explain."
"July 22, 2014","I had this app on my Galaxy tab2, formatted the tab and now I'm unable to install it back. Gives an error 'Out of space' and shows 8.3gb free space on the internal drive. I'm on ART though so it could be related to that."
"May 3, 2016","Perfect fit with my samsung note for playing endless music on the go easy to use."

"July 22, 2015","Love the service. Great selection overall."
"April 19, 2016","Easy to use. Lots of free music and loads easily on my phone. I'm done with iTunes!!!"
"July 18, 2015","This used to be my favorite Amazon app. I was very excited when the prime music became available, even though the music selection was very limited. However, in the past month or so I've hardly between able to use the app because it keeps crashing. I get error messages constantly, I can't download items or delete items with the app freezing and its even screwing up the album cover thumbnail with the artist (putting a Beatles album cover with a Rolling Stones album for example). Often it takes a bunch of random songs and throws them together in an ""unknown artist"" album. What? I hope Amazon fixes these issues soon, otherwise I'll be deleting the app and finding one that actually works."
"July 24, 2016","I didnt know i can get music happy i found that out i luv music"
"April 27, 2016","Meets expectations. Can find almost all the songs I am looking for. Still exploring."
"July 20, 2016","Just as good as Apple Music but free with your Prime Membership."
"February 28, 2015","Excellent music selection that is thrown in with the prime. Great up temple playlists for running and workouts. I would give it 5 stars if Amazon would make a andriod wear app."
"September 19, 2016","Unlimited music, great selection, and easy to use."
"April 14, 2016","Great sound and amazon saves music so when you get a different phone it will be there."
"August 16, 2015","the service is great but they should have more artist's because sometimes I punch in the band only to find out they are not on their server."
"October 8, 2015","Love it!!! I conveniently had prime before this was available. One of the only memberships that I have kept and always will.!!"
"August 27, 2016","Very good selection of music, easy to use and download"
"March 30, 2014","The quality of the playback on my Nexus 10 is excellent. It is even better on my bluetooth connected speakers. The player will not only play Amazon bought MP3, but ones which I have gotten from various web sites; things such as presentations."
"November 21, 2015","This app is fantastic!! Easy and has a lot of songs you can add to your library and listen to at will. A great product"

"May 21, 2017","It crashes.."
"July 18, 2015","It's very nice. I only gave it a 4. Because it doesn't have all the songs I'm looking for. But I'm enjoying the ones they do have. Thanks Amazin."
"September 21, 2016","need to download some music, might need some help"

"December 8, 2016","I can not download the program."
"May 30, 2016","Can't create stations like Pandora. Some features not completely intuitive."
"December 9, 2016","Sit down, select some music...any genre, enjoy!"
"May 21, 2015","Quality is great just not enough music choices and artists quantity is small. Once they get more it will easily be five stars. Love the lyrics no commercial."
"May 22, 2013","Ok, this is a great app and the cloud drive is terrific. The music store is very broad and deep with selections. BUT: the music player will not show up ad an independent icon, you have to go through the Amazon Appstore app. I am amazed by Amazon's lack of common sense and intuitivity! COME ON GUYS!"
"June 13, 2015","Not the easiest to use but the idea is nice. I like the fact that you can rewind and fast forward AND no ads! All included in the price for Amazon Prime!"
"May 1, 2017","AWESOME SET UP"

"December 15, 2016","Great music site and library"
"July 15, 2015","Since I love classical music and can find this easily on prime music I am very pleased with Amazon Music with Prime Music! Great Combination."
"March 29, 2016","It won't update on my Motorola Droid Turbo 2. Before the latest update, it worked great."
"October 5, 2016","It is one of the many bonuses of having prime"
"May 31, 2016","Excellent. Easy to use. Its nice being able to listen to my music anytime."
"June 10, 2015","Slow, not intuitive to use. Too many steps needed just to listen to your music. Much better for selecting and buying music than it is at playing music."
"April 26, 2016","Great to have all my amazon music available anywhere I can get a wifi connection !"
"October 30, 2015","Great app for the prime members. I am switching this app from spotify. Would rate for five if they provide more selection."
"November 22, 2016","Good but sometimes cuts in and out"
"October 7, 2015","I love Amazon Prime Misic. It's got such a huge library and 1000's of playlists! Definitely a must have! Best value in music!"

"May 13, 2016","I love Amazon Music it's a great way of listening to new up and coming Artist."
"May 3, 2015","Great music available but it would be nice if I could download it to my iTunes library. I have read reviews of how to download to iTunes but none of them worked."
"October 29, 2015","Love Prime music. Great for listening to my favorite musicians and music. Can listen from my phone through my car system."
"February 20, 2015","Geared way too much on selling, not a lot of independent content to choose from. Must choose from play lists. Too bad because the more choice to listen, the more hooked to buy."
"March 9, 2016","I love this album. It's on repeat all day everyday and in gym. Kat graham you are a beast!!!"
"April 12, 2016","Glitchy at best, irritating nuances, less than optimal interface, but I still use it."
"February 29, 2016","Love how I can have this on several devices and all sync up so I have my music with me always."
"September 9, 2015","For some reason known only to Amazon, all of the songs I've digitally bought from them are not showing up on the old app or this app."
"April 8, 2015","Nice selection of free music, but the app won't allow saving to an SD card so it uses up internal memory quickly, Samsung S5. Also will not work on a Samsung tablet."
"September 9, 2015","The playlist I chose that night streamed in flawless order, and it was a great listen. I intend to use my prime music streaming more."
"August 15, 2014","I was excited to try Amazon Prime, but was disappointed to find out I couldn't watch any movies or read kindle books without having any of the compatible devices. If you have an android device this isn't for you."
"January 30, 2017","Amazon Music really helped me to gather all of my family's music in one place so that I have it available to play on my Amazon Echo Dot. We had some music that we bought from Amazon, and some from iTunes. By downloading this App, paying for the cloud storage, and uploading my entire library from one computer, and combining that with music from another PC, we finally have all of our digital music available to play on the Echo Dot.  We also needed to agree to become an ""Amazon Household"" which was one of the key ingredients in pulling all of our music together. So far, we are very pleased with the results."
"September 2, 2016","I have only started using the app but so far so good"
"June 8, 2015","Ordering a CD & getting immediate access to the music via Amazon's Cloud, plus all the free music with Amazon Prime are great reasons why I use this app."
"August 29, 2016","Way better than any other music channels you can get!"
"November 10, 2017","Dosent work outside the usa"
"February 25, 2017","Very handy. Lots of titles."

"December 2, 2016","Amazon music is the best..."
"May 30, 2017","Outstanding!!"
"April 7, 2015","Love it. I'm not enamored with today's music. Amazon music with prime gives me music I like and allows me to store it as albums in which I can categorize as I prefer."
"December 28, 2015","Pretty schweet side benefit to Amazon Prime! Great selection - if you listen to it, it's probably on there."
"November 9, 2015","Love this. I get to listen to new music without buying the cd. And I love the variety. I have a wide range of interests"
"July 20, 2015","The interface needs some fine tuning and finding songs or searching through the library on my phone or tablet is okay, but could be much better."
"August 29, 2014","Prime is Awesome I couldn't believe all the Great songs they have for free. Everyone should try Prime you will like it."
"September 30, 2015","Not impressed. Thought there would be more albums by the same artist, turns out there is limited choices by my favorite artists."
"October 2, 2016","Quite pleased with the selection and variety."
"December 10, 2016","Easy to use. Lots of choices."
"November 26, 2015","A lot of songs are not covered by Prime membership. App feels like a bait and switch. I'll stick with Google Music."
"February 18, 2016","I like a variety of music genres. I find I can fulfill many of my musical preferences with ease."
"January 31, 2016","Love Amazon Prime Music. Has most any song you want to listen to. Listen for free with Amazon Prime."
"March 2, 2016","Works very good but it does not sync with your primary players playlists the old version did."
"March 28, 2016","Awesome app, has all my favorite music, and i can play my music with no restrictions..."
"February 4, 2016","Amazon Music with Prime Music is so much simpler, the library is Fire! I'm ready to cancel Spotify."
"September 15, 2015","I like the ease of purchasing the songs. 2 things to improve on: -Crash during song sampling. -More music selection."
"May 5, 2016","I am a beginner at collecting music, but Amazon has made it pretty easy for me!"
"December 17, 2016","Cant login in my mac laptop"
"December 3, 2015","I like it, but I like Pandora better, maybe because I've been using it longer. I'll probably keep using Pandora."
"December 21, 2014","I dont like that I had to download your app in order to hear the song. Very complicated and not what I wanted. Wanted it downloaded to my computer as I used to do in the past. Not happy."
"May 27, 2014","Does everything I like it for. Have had some solid builds and fixed issues along the way. I would like to see a wish list ability to remember what I looked at. Maybe also start Amazon streaming to take on Pandora and Spotify."
"April 13, 2015","Great app I use amazon prime and use my phone to play the music thru my sound system"
"November 24, 2016","Works great just costing to much"
"July 5, 2014","What's up with the data usage? This app used almost one gig in less than three hours running in the background. I wasn't even using it. Thankfully I had a usage warning set up or else I would have gone over. Disabled it."
"April 24, 2016","Amazing!! The best radio and playlists, I don't know what I ever did without it👍"

"December 9, 2016","It's okay. I prefer spotify."
"June 27, 2014","Hi, Didn't mean to apply if it will cost me automatically. Not sure how to use it if it doesn't charge me. Please inform me if automatic charge so that I can reevaluate whether I want it. Thanks, Eleanor Dixon"
"August 17, 2016","So easy and such a joy. Worthwhile to invest in prime."
"February 28, 2015","Works pretty well. I would like a clearer way to delete some music though. And they need to have a wider variety of songs on there. The app up and stops every now and then."
"November 23, 2015","I pre ordered Adele 25 & it was delivered as promised! I love that it automatically is downloaded into my Library!"
"December 28, 2016","Does not work on my Mac. My Mac is barely a year old, but the software acts like something is wrong with the computer. I have tried to uninstalled and reinstalled several times already, yet the results are the same every time. I recently attempted to upload some music and it showed that it completed the upload, but failed as it uploaded 20% of the music I needed to upload and did not upload the rest. For the past year and a half, it's been a real pain to upload music. I wish I could get a refund for the services as it barely work anytime that I need it. I'm extremely disappointed with how this software has continued to fail for several years and still does to this day."

"December 27, 2016","Listen to it all the time"
"December 2, 2016","Very good holds your interest"

"July 21, 2015","Great App! Wonderful that it is free."

"December 22, 2015","The app crashes a lot, and the library of prime music is miniscule when compared to google play all access."
"September 27, 2016","Great item, highly recommend. AAAAAAA+++++++"
"February 8, 2015","Haven't looked in to using this app yet. I downloaded it when it was a free offering. I assume it will operate well as Amazon does a great job with all programs and services."
"December 17, 2014","So much free music with Prime, it's great! Tons of older songs that you can DL to your device and listen to anytime without a connection. Playlists are easy to create too. I like it."
"October 5, 2016","It's very good has a wide variety of music"
"April 19, 2015","90% there. Just a few procedures were not as clear at first. I like the playlist feature a whole lot! This will turn into a 5 star very soon. Well worth it."
"January 18, 2012","needs to integrate the wish list and recommended for you features from the amazon web site and amazon android app. it's a pain to constantly switch between the amazon app and amazon mp3 app to preview recommended songs and refer to my wish list. the fundamental features of the mp3 app are implemented well though. the cloud storage service works great for purchases."
"April 26, 2016","Amazon is by far the worlds best source for free entertainment and here here..."
"July 13, 2016","Has alot of great songs but is missing a lot of my favorites."
"January 12, 2016","The music runs the vibration in the phone ringer. The app never shuts down and is a huge resource hog."
"July 31, 2012","well, I loved this app and raved about it to all that would listen. the free GBs were plenty for the majority of cds I listen to. well, fast forward to todays update. no longer is there a free amount of space. now I have to erase a good number of songs to be under the 250 tune limit. this sucks. I'm leaning toward giving Google music a try."
"July 4, 2016","Love love love my music through Amazon. It is all I listen to!"
"November 21, 2015","Ok"
"September 16, 2016","What a great addition to the Prime Membership."

"November 29, 2015","as advertised"
"October 14, 2015","This is a great option! No commercials, no paying extra (like pandora, etc). I wish Audible would have a similar set up!"

"April 23, 2013","It's nice to know that some of the songs from CDs that I ordered are on it, and I didn't even download them there. So that was a very nice surprise. I downloaded this app on my Android phone, my tablet, and my PC. So I can listen to my music anywhere I go, as long as I have one of the three devices"
"August 25, 2015","Uses data constantly. Even the music and videos I buy can't be saved to prevent excessive data usage. Why buy it if you never own it?"
"September 25, 2015","Thought I'd be able to listen to music without Internet or wifi after downloading, I can't and it's spotty. Good music though"
"October 15, 2016","It is simply awesome and simple to use."

"April 19, 2015","Music at your fingertips -- another advantage of having Prime! While easy to get the app for a home computer, I had more difficulty adding it to my HDX Kindle."
"December 18, 2016","I really like the app."
"November 12, 2015","I love the fact you can download the music to your device so you can play it off-line without messing with the DRM."
"December 1, 2016","getting better w/ each month"

"July 24, 2016","It works when it wants and the offline music doesn't work"
"December 27, 2012","I find that this free app for storing your music online is one of the better ones out there. It allows you room for storing 250 songs for free, at first I thought that 250 wouldn't be enough, however, I was totaly rong. 250 is really quite abit of music. Thank you Amazon.com you come through for me once again. Marty"

Those are the commercials!"

"December 30, 2015","Does not work well, as it should, file downloads do not show up, not a great selection, jenky at best"
"October 22, 2016","I prefer Amazon music over Sirius."
"January 11, 2014","FORGET IT.  Itunes has me by the balls because I Can't listen to ANY of my music because of the stupid DRM protection! Amazon, Google both don't support DRM files and I didn't even know I had this issue until I got rid of my Iphone...UGH!"
"May 22, 2013","I was a long time supporter of the Google Play Store Music app but after the recent updates you cannot distinguish between free and purchased music plus it was closing everything seconds. I tried to see what Amazon had and I could not be happier. I will be sticking to this app from now on"
"February 3, 2016","Great but I will use others over this because of the inability to set a sleep timer or alarm."

"May 19, 2014","Works fine for a free app. I use it on all my tablets and phone. Good if you buy music from AMAZON so you can get it from the CLOUD. Even the cd's you buy can be down loaded before you receive them so they are always there."
"October 27, 2015","Great tool. The cloud application is awesome. Amazon does it again.... I would absolutely recommend this to anyone."

"May 19, 2015","This library of music is astonishing to the ears, mind, and eyes. This along with the Prime Video more than justify the cost of the yearly membership."
"August 7, 2014","I'm really jazzed to be able to download free songs from all the lists. Then I move them to my device to listen without using my data plan. Best of all Amazon offers tech help with this that's easy to use."
"June 16, 2014","Don't expect it to be like Spotify, Slacker or Pandora. Maybe I haven't the found the feature, but it doesn't seem like this will play songs based on something you're currently listening to. There are already preexisting playlists, and you can create your own. But the nice thing about these other apps is that it allows you to discover new artists or less commercially successful songs. I don't know if not adding this feature was on purpose, putting them pretty much in direct competition with the sites/apps mentioned above. I would have been a great feature, and I'd give it four or five stars then."
"January 28, 2016","Love the free music and the fact that each member of the family can create there own play list"

"July 15, 2016","Nothing much to say except it worked as it should've. 😀"
"September 28, 2015","It is too user unfriendly. Music is difficult to find and listen too. It takes a good amount of time to learn how to use."
"July 26, 2014","Im rating 4 stars Just because i cant sync my music on my phone using spanish lenguage, so i had to change the lenguage from spanish to english in order to sync. Please fix this! The app and music is awesome!"
"October 7, 2015","Does not permit me to access Prime Music through my family account. This seriously devalues the worth of Amazon Prime."
"June 20, 2014","It doesn't have everything that I have searched for, but I think it is good enough to replace Google Music for me. I wouldn't subscribe to Prime just for it, but it is a nice perk to go with my existing subscription."
"September 9, 2016","Love that there are no ads and commercials."
"September 22, 2016","Love this app. I listen at work all day."
"December 17, 2015","I get to listen to music while I am just about anywhere. I only wish I could down load to my computer."
"February 16, 2014","I found downloading MP3's from Amazon very convenient and quick. I not very computer savy and I was able to download music. I would definitely consider downloading more music. Also I like the cloud....keep the good and latest music coming!!"
"July 31, 2015","it has everything I want !!!!"
"August 9, 2016","Too little international music. Wish you had Kpop."
"May 16, 2015","If I could give you zero I would. Your app crashes all the time and deletes out my online library. Fix the app...can't use prime music...really sucks!"
"May 30, 2015","Its pretty great! I can download some music for free. There are also some songs that have lyrics that you can read along while the song is playing."
"July 21, 2015","Lots of buffering. Not sure if it's the app or my service. I don't usually have that problem with Pandora. Otherwise I love the music!"
"September 12, 2016","It was nice to have commercial free music."
"December 4, 2014","This is so stupid that I can't download an Amazon app to an Amazon kindle fire hd.... I'm mean really....this has to be the absolute stupid thing I've encountered in a looking time."
"May 12, 2016","Love Amazon Music! What a great perk to get with my Prime Membership!"
"June 17, 2016","Under normal circumstances this app deserves a good solid 4 stars. With the newest version however, I have to downgrade my assessment and take away 2 of those stars because what should be a standard feature of any music player no longer works. The newest version breaks the shuffle feature almost completely- especially if you have amassed a library with thousands of songs.  In the old version, when you toggled the shuffle feature, your songs would be played in a somewhat random fashion- as should be expected. In this new version, when you toggle the shuffle feature, a contiguous block of up to 500 songs is automatically selected, and it is only from within that block of songs that there is any randomization. I don't find this acceptable in the slightest.  I like the new ""Play Queue"" feature, however when I enable the shuffle feature, I expect a play queue to be built that is completely random and could possibly include any of the songs in my library, not just a contiguous chunk of 500 songs."
"January 11, 2016","I LOVE Amazon music. I am always listening. If only I could figure out how to get it in my car..."
"August 2, 2015","Great app and so easy to use!"

"May 18, 2015","I have had countless issues with Amazon music setting within Amazon for my account, and so far they have not been able to fix the issues! I hate it!!"
"June 20, 2015","has some issues if you had purchased it before then got a neww tablet trying to get it loaded on it kept saying it was installed but was not."

"May 26, 2015","Love prime music playing beautiful sound's easy to use and safe application you can appreciate. Ty amazon music with prime music!!!!***** <3:)"
"October 9, 2015","I like the idea of amazon music, but the execution is very poor. When I'm driving, which is when I tend to listen to music, the music stalls and stutters. I can rarely get through an entire song. It doesn't seem to matter whether I'm playing music from the cloud or if it's downloaded. Even the streams you've created don't work properly. Very frustrating."
"April 30, 2016","Compliments Apple music perfectly! Love the playlists. Keep them coming."
"January 9, 2014","THIS app is so user-friendly and it has songs and tracks, albums even certain podcasts I'd never imagine it would've. You can find anything. And i mean anything. Downloads quick and doesn't freeze or lag like the other. Definitely give it a try."

"February 16, 2016","I love it...wish I had started using it sooner. It's music the whole family can enjoy!!"

"December 18, 2012","Amazon gives you 5 GB of space but they have lowered the space for your music. The good thing is that because if you have a mobile device or a tablet, this gives you access to the collection that you can't do without. And, it's free. Just wished that Amazon upgraded it to have some kind of built-in EQ/Amp."

"April 21, 2016","love to listen to various playlists and a variety of curated channels."
"December 17, 2013","I pay $25 a year to be able to store all my music in the Amazon cloud, and I'm very happy to be able to listen to my music at home, at work, or, with this app, anyplace I've got a 4G or Wi-Fi signal.  So far, so good.  But, there are horrible limitations with this app that Amazon could easily fix, if they wanted to:  1) It won't download music to your SD card I bought a 64GB SD card so I could listen to my music when I didn't have a connection (and also so I wouldn't have to worry about using too much data). But when it downloads music it goes to your phone's internal memory, and can't be set to use an SD card. Why? Why? Why? My Galaxy Note II has just 16GB of internal memory, which is needed for programs, etc. There is not much space to store a bunch of music. That's why I bought the SD card (from Amazon!). Google Music let's you download to SD - you can too!  2) It will let you download your music, but still streams it from the cloud I was enjoying listening to my music from the Amazon cloud so much that I was pushing against my Verizon data limits. No problem, I thought, I'll just use the handy download function in the app. So, before a big car trip I created a playlist and clicked the download button. On the drive I pulled up the playlist and started to play it. Everything seemed great until I lost the 4G signal and the music stopped. What happened? Hadn't I downloaded the songs? Well, yes, the songs had downloaded to my phone, but the stupid Amazon MP3 player was still streaming the songs over the Internet, even though it ""knew"" that it had already downloaded them all. Stupid!  3) No gapless playback. Try listening to Dark Side of the Moon or Abbey Road with gaps between all the songs and it just ruins the experience."
"January 29, 2016","Love all the free prime music! Great for when I go on runs to have my music right there!"
"September 16, 2016","Excellent service, excellent choices"
"August 19, 2016","I needed music for a party for my coworkers retirement. They put me in charge of getting music and I was easily able to find it here on Amazon. That in itself is a blessing. Once I purchased the music I needed, I needed to download this app in order to play it. Normally this would suck and I would hate it but it's made everything so much easier. So I downloaded this app and it has the music that I have purchased right there. I can download the music on my phone so that when I am in the party, it's not using my data in order to play it. It can just play from my phone. I like that part. I have downloaded the music that I purchased and created an album to play my music through for the party so it's easily accessible and ready for use. It also adds my songs that I currently have on my phone so I don't have to manually switch those over. Overall this is a great app, especially if you have prime. There are a lot of songs that you can get for free because of prime."
"October 29, 2011","The only reason I got this application was because I wanted to buy ONE mp3 album through Amazon mobile. But after browsing the selection I end up downloading FIVE mp3 albums. This was surprising because I still preferred buying hardcopy CDs. Amazon has a good selection of music, smooth browsing, music cloud, option to download to phone and competitive pricing."
"December 4, 2014","Kem Christmas songs are sharp."
"July 4, 2015","It's getting better, but I still have problems with it force closing on me. With or without letting me know. Sometimes, it'll tell me there's a problem try again, and other times it'll just stop and we'll stop. No warning. But other than that, I love that I can listen to full albums without interruptions though. I also love that I can search through Amazon prime to find more music as well while listening to music still. It shows whats available on amazon prime. Love that. A few fixes and then this would be a great app and would get 5 stars."
"July 22, 2015","Love it better than pandora"

"March 29, 2016","Content is good, software problems (updates) with Android Marshmallow bad."
"June 29, 2014","Just starting the Prime Music experience and finding my way around, that's why it's a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating . . . can't beat the price and it looks as though a 5 star rating may be on the horizon!"
"August 28, 2016","Unfortunately won't work with my Kindle."
"July 2, 2016","One of my favorite perks about my Prime Membership!!!"
"July 13, 2015","Easy download, simple to use, music played well for the most part but there were a couple of songs that had minor skips in playback."
"April 27, 2016","This is awesome to be able to listen to pretty much anything I want!"

"September 27, 2013","I love this app I have not had any trouble with this, in downloading my music and when I am using my tablet, and there's no wifi, I can still listen to my music, it is worth the 5 stars!"
"June 22, 2014","With all these perks for Prime members...we always use Prime first. Always worth the money for membership. Music at your fingertips on any device you have.  I give this 5 stars! Great move Amazon!"

"August 6, 2015","Say goodbye to Pandora"
"September 25, 2016","A very good product because it lets you find songs and albums and lets you listen to it as much as you like... and all this is included with prime. I recently heard a song that triggered so much memories for me I was thinking of going to buy the whole album again. Luckily, the song and the whole album was available on Prime Music (whereas it was not available in the other music streaming services). I was able to download into my phone, and down memory lane we went! What's nice is that the whole album is still available off line after downloading the songs! Highly recommend this service!"
"December 13, 2016","Good Tunes!!!!!"
"January 30, 2015","I liked cloudplayer better. This scans all your storage memory and makes a ginormous db of all music. It needs a setting to list just amazon music, not every music."
"August 8, 2016","love this stuff! great selections available"
"October 9, 2015","Prime music is great! I have used several different platforms. I love the layout of Amazon Prime Music the best."
"November 3, 2016","Beats Pandora by a mile!"
"June 1, 2015","Prime does not support Google Chromecast so you cannot stream music or video directly to your TV and sound system like you can with Netflix."
"April 28, 2016","Average music app. Even after I downloaded it I never used it much."
"August 29, 2014","I love that it comes with prime (along with free shipping, tv and movies, and books) but sadly not everything for the music is free, but I still find a lot of free stuff that looks good for music"
"August 29, 2016","Has not been able to update for months."
"April 4, 2015","Just no match for even the likes of Spotify, though even that service misses much of the music I enjoy. Fortunately I didn't join prime for the music."

"January 25, 2017","Great stuff !"
"August 31, 2017","Cool Playlist"
"January 1, 2017","Excellent App"
"October 3, 2016","worth the money to invest in it"
"March 29, 2016","Performance-wise, the app delivers music with good speed and quality, and the prime music selection is pretty solid. The user interface has a tendency to feel clunky and at times counter-intuitive. Search algorithm should be better optimized. As-is, the system often just displays all the covers available through prime music without mentioning the original artist. This leaves the user wondering if the search went wrong. When someone searches for a song, it should display the original artist first, with track availability (unavailable, purchase-only, or PRIME). It would be nice to see how popular the covers are too as part of the search result."
"August 28, 2016","Use it everyday and always recommend it"
"July 15, 2016","The only app to download your music to any device"

"May 19, 2016","Love that I can download preset playlists for offline playback"
"June 18, 2014","The prime music is a great added benefit. I enjoy the app, but do not always want to deal with playlists. Please add the ability to select a song and add in to either next or last in queue while playing music."
"March 11, 2016","Take it with you feature is great to have for trips in areas without service."
"November 29, 2014","With your Prime account you get music playlists for any mood that you might be in. weather your working on your car or cleaning up around the house there's a playlist for you."

"May 27, 2016","Can't figure out how to access without opening amazon first."
"August 31, 2016","I'm so glad I have a prime membership!"
"March 14, 2016","Sometimes take a lot of signal to load, otherwise, a fun app to listen with."
"July 6, 2014","Unnecessarily complex and not an improvement over the previous version. Would prefer to roll back. Unstable, sometimes causes playlists to disappear. Application needs to add feature to better equalize."
"October 28, 2015","As an Amazon prime member I really enjoy the slu of selections of music I am able to make my own playlists."
"December 13, 2016","It works great"

"February 1, 2016","I have always enjoyed Amazon music and will continue to do so with my mobile products"
"May 22, 2013","You know I have heard a lot of praise for Amazom and it's app's I'd like to know what product the apps were used with { only kindel } . Because I've had nothing but problems when it comes to using amazon apps for Android. Ready to give up not to bother with Amazon and it's Apps"

"September 26, 2015","Great!"
"January 18, 2015","What is not to like? I get my prime music through whatever device I have this one. I just have to make sure I'm in a wifi area since my data plan is not unlimited."
"January 29, 2017","Update. Changing my review up. Evidently if you choose to save on an SD card, then your purchased music is very nicely saved in easy to find mp3 files.  --+++++++++ I am very dissapointed Amazon music no longer saves my purchased music in simple to find, copy, read format. Because it used to save this way was one of the main reasons why I purchased music on Amazon instead of Google or iTunes."

"March 3, 2015","When I bought Prime I had high hopes that this would compare to Google Play Music, and it does! I have half the mind to cancel my subscription to Play Music."

"May 8, 2015","I love it. I would give it 5 stars but you can't do a shuffle all for all your artists. Maybe you can and I don't know how. Otherwise great!"
"September 16, 2016","Love the variety that is offered."
"February 27, 2013","While it was at first a bit confusing as to which app, e.g., Kindle, Amazon MP3, Amazon Apps, etc, I should use, once the MP3 download happened, it has been working fine. Have already been playing my old CDs bought years ago from Amazon thru our car\phone Bluetooth. Sounds as good as the CDs."

"July 24, 2015","I have been using Amazon for most of my MP3 downloads for 4 years now, and I have never had an issue with downloading music onto my Windows PCs( Media Player ).

"August 19, 2014","Love the free music for my Android phone. I love being a Prime member and all the perks that go along with it. Top music (at least music I listen to) is available for all my favorite artists."
"September 7, 2015","Haven't had a chance to use it all that long yet. Seems very good, but does not have some music i was searching for"
"August 29, 2015","No where as good as good play music.. Less tracks available as a prime member, interface is horrible, no EQ....."

"July 19, 2016","Love the variety of ways I can access music."
"February 4, 2016","love it with the amazon player I have over two hours of music while on the road."
"December 6, 2016","Works great!"
"February 16, 2016","I'm finding to much music requires ""purchases"", I thought with Amazon Prime music, like almost anything was free to play, but it's not. Some examples are: Metallica, Shinedown, Bob Segar...these all only play ""copyright"" samples, unless you go purchase the song. Fortunately, for me I have quite an extensive music library, I'm able to upload songs to my cloud library, but that as well has a limit of 250 songs!!!??? But for the most part, I'll use it some, just to get my moneys worth, but there is a lot of room for improvement, and this should all be transparently explained up front. (NOT buried in the depths of hell in the t & c's like it's trying to be hidden)"
"April 22, 2016","I really like that with Amazon Prime I can listen to music for free. What a deal!"
"December 10, 2016","Pretty good"
"April 26, 2016","I love the app. Easy access to the music you want to listen to."

"December 10, 2015","I don't want anything to do with the ""CLOUD"" and I don't like having it pushed on me."

"July 15, 2016","Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it."
"August 5, 2014","Fantastic & makes it easier to load music from all genres to listen to without internet. One suggestion, as storage takes up a lot of space, would like to be able to add to external device"
"August 10, 2016","Great selection and quality of sound!"
"January 9, 2017","Loving it"
"May 14, 2016","I love that I can pick a station and the music just plays."

"February 17, 2016","I was unclear whether I would need to pay to listen since I have Amazon prime"
"November 3, 2014","Amazing selection!!! The customized playlists are great. I recommend AMAZON PRIME MUSIC 🎶 to EVERYONE!!! Makes having an Amazon Prime account an even better value than before."
"July 14, 2016","Haven't worked out yet but I think I like it"

"August 17, 2014","Where'd the cloud player go? Now if you accidentally delete a song MP3 you bought, or the file gets corrupted, it looks like you can't get it back again. I liked the green one, not this junk."
"January 27, 2015","It let's you listen to your Prime Music/Playlist and your own music. It's improved a lot over the years! I still think the interface is a bit clunky however.."

"February 7, 2013","The Music is very expensive. I can find the same thing on line for a better price. I couldn't get the shortcut on my android."
"February 17, 2015","We paid for Spotify and I'm not sure why! Amazon Prime Music has everything I'm interested in listening to and the playlists are diverse and entertaining."
"August 14, 2016","Still new to it but liking it so far"

"December 18, 2016","Love it"
"May 19, 2015","Prime just kicked it up again. First with videos now music,it should make people want to sign up for prime member with thous two things."
"September 13, 2014","Crashes right when it opens. Was working just a few days ago and now it crashes immediately when trying to play a song both on stored cloud and device.  Please fix... Thanks!"
"December 31, 2014","Good way to listen to my Amazon MP3s, however the player is not very clean. Would like an easier way to build playlists from my own music and mix with Prime music."

"March 8, 2016","Very easy to use. Quality music. Purchase and play instantly."
"August 2, 2014","I've been using Amazon Prime Music for about a month and I love it. The music selection just got much bigger and is very ecclectic. It's a wonderful ""pot sweetener"" for Prime customers."
"August 24, 2015","I really really really really real like it. Having prime lets you listen to the entire song without buying it first"
"August 24, 2015","i would love to have more options for free streaming. also i would love to have more countries added for this App."
"September 21, 2016","Amazon prime is the best!!!"
"January 16, 2014","Downloading my music was very easy. I found the app to be user friendly; however, once I downloaded my music, I had trouble with the player. Sometimes my songs would cut in/out for no apparent reason (I checked connectivity, etc.)."
"April 10, 2016","This is awesome. No doing that make me crazy just my favorites."
"February 22, 2014","I had never used the MP3 service before --I was amazed at its simplicity.Amazon ROCKS!!! I was able to thru the app share my music in multiple devices. My Music is everywhere I --not need it-- but WANT IT! AMAZON ROCKS"
"December 16, 2016","love it"
"December 31, 2015","Love the music library, easy to search, and just a ton of music from different genres."
"February 1, 2016","There is no music history, or way to customize the existing radio stations other than rating the song currently playing. I accidentally thumbed down a song I really liked, and now will never hear it again since there's no way to undo this action. Good design based on HCI principles should not allow for permanent consequences from simple user error. It's also not well documented whether rating a song affects all stations, or only the current station - for instance, I may not want to hear Philadelphia on my Classic Rock station between The Who and Hendrix, but I may have a Rock Ballads station that it would be perfectly acceptable on. Rating the song on one station shouldn't affect the other. If this behavior was better documented, and a simple rating history feature was implemented, Prime Music could replace my Pandora One subscription since I'm already an Amazon Prime member. #AnthonyNaddeo - get busy and fix this for me."
"November 21, 2015","I didn't know there was a prime music until I got my first smart phone. I love, love, love it!"
"July 22, 2015","Love prime radio :)"
"October 16, 2015","So far I'm liking it on my BlackBerry SE Passport, very smooth and loads fast. Very good sound quality."
"January 23, 2017","thanks"
"January 29, 2017","Great!"
"January 30, 2017","ok app"
"March 4, 2015","Like the file, it could use a more user  friendly app,other than that the music sounds awesome.thank you p.s add some R&B music of the 70's n 80's"
"December 6, 2016","I love it"
"July 15, 2016","I use it because it's included with prime."
"January 13, 2016","Purchasing music here doesn't automatically put it with my other music files. PITA"
"January 1, 2015","If you have amazon prime this is great to download free play list or music to listen to at home or in the car. Not sure if I would really use this without prime."
"October 15, 2015","Easy to use. I always find my favorite music. It works well with rhe music stores on my mobile devices!"
"April 25, 2017","This app is by far the biggest piece of junk and it keeps getting worse. It CONSTANTLY syncs the cloud library which seems to slow down the device way too often. Buying individual songs vs buying whole albums causes issues when adding the music to your device, the streaming is really a joke and always cuts out if a stiff breeze comes along. All in all this app is a waste of time unless you download the music to a personal library and play it from an app made by people who know what their doing. I bought 4 songs off an album, for some reason it didn't add them to my phone. I tried then buying the full album to see if that would work and it downloaded all the songs but the first 4 I bought. I go to the amazon website to see if I can download the songs to my computer and then transfer them, nope, apparently there is a problem with my download and all I am able to do is submit a ticket. Seriously amazon, I expect more."
"September 14, 2016","Love it. Just what I needed."
"July 7, 2013","It is adequate, no guide to tell you how to navigate through it.  Works well with downloaded music from Amazon.  Being able to purchase hard copy of CD and have MP3 instantly for the same price (or lower !) makes I-Tunes far less superior!"
"June 16, 2014","I don't like that I have to add songs to my list to listen to music. I just want to click a station and ihave play music."
"August 1, 2016","Haven't spent enough time with it yet."
"April 26, 2016","love it omg greatest ever especially if your a prime member."
"August 14, 2016","Love this relaxing version so much!"
"May 14, 2016","Great for listening to whole albums for no extra charge."
"September 13, 2015","I love music... amazon music gives me everything. .. I just hookup my phone and ride... 90s hiphop is my fave!"
"September 26, 2015","Like the app but I do wish that one day this would be part of amazon underground where it is actually FREE."
"January 7, 2014","I like this app just wish there was an option to pick the size of the music. It pulled in all my ring tones and I don't want them in my song list. There may be a way to delete them, but it would gave been easier to have that option."
"February 29, 2016","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FRX0MY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0"
"May 9, 2016","I think of it as programmable radio just for me. Love it."
"June 18, 2014","The app will not run on my BlackBerry using OS 10.2.1.2674. With Amazon and BlackBerry teaming up and having Amazon app store later this year on BlackBerry OS 10.3 maybe this will change and will work."

"October 9, 2016","Free Music, Nuff Said."
"December 13, 2016","Awesome"
"December 20, 2014","This app crashes a lot. A cool feature of this app is that it plays lyrics along with some songs and for those of us who love to sing along, the lyrics are helpful."

"October 14, 2014","Sucks!"
"September 7, 2016","Selections are pretty decent!"
"February 10, 2016","Good music choices. Hard to understand how and where to buy music downloads."
"August 12, 2016","Great way to hear old and new music"

"August 7, 2015","Great choices"
"December 11, 2014","Cannot cast to Chromecast, not a huge surprise there. Limited functionality within the phone app for Android. The fact I can't cast is probably the #1 killer for me."

"September 22, 2016","This really works for me."

"December 14, 2016","Nice!"
"January 16, 2016","App doesn't work on my Android (Samsung Note). It had worked fine for quite some time and then one day stopped working properly. I went through Amazon ""tech support,"" which was a joke. The tech told me the problem was that I didn't have the latest version. It was a real hassle to download the latest version because I first had to download some Amazon App which is equivalent to a play store. The tech informed me that if I downloaded it elsewhere (like from other play stores or even the Amazon site) it wouldn't be the latest version. In the end it still didn't work, so the tech did some more checking and then told me they were having issues with Samsung devices but were working on it. Very frustrating and a big waste of time. Amazon Music works fine on my iPhone and, of course, through my Fire TV, but the music is very limited if you're not into pop stuff. This made the whole experience even worse because it wasn't worth my time. Amazon really needs to get it together if they expect to compete with Pandora and Spotify. ."
"July 18, 2016","Loved the genre setup. Good job Amazon."
"December 1, 2016","Love it!"
"November 11, 2014","not sure about all the things it has to offer and what price i am paying"
"January 13, 2013","My first go around with the old cloud player was not the best experience. Since Amazon put out their new cloud player I'm impressed and sold on it. I went ahead and joined Amazon Prime and find it so much easier now to play my music from the cloud player on any of my devices. Thanks Amazon!"
"December 19, 2015","Free music to stream? Make your own playlists? Use premade genra lists? Umm yes plz!"
"January 6, 2016","I have had Prime for a while but had not utilized the Music portion. I am in love!"

"December 8, 2016","Great!"
"August 9, 2015","Easy to use"
"September 16, 2016","can not use on my region."
"February 10, 2015","I love prime for the shipping, but I find the music player to be weird and not intuitive at all, plus the content just isn't up to snuff in my opinion."
"May 30, 2015","Music selection is decent, but not amazing. Some volume levels are different so you have to turn it up or down from time to time."
"June 20, 2014","I am so excited to find all this music!! I can have it on my computer, Kindle, phone! Only problem I've had so far is actually searching for a particular song, but maybe I'll figure that out soon."
"March 16, 2016","Pretty good selection but do not have everything I am looking for."
"May 1, 2015","So far so good. I love that there is a variety of stations and you can add songs to your Playlist while listening to it on the radio. ;)"
"November 11, 2016","Too much pop"
"December 11, 2016","Nice."
"February 17, 2013","mp3 is great for music, I use no other because everyone is using this now and you don't even have to go to the music store anymore especaily the mall, aweful prices, I don't buy cds anymore just download mp3s easy and quick and great. I buy all my mp3's here on amazon. no other place!"
"October 24, 2016","Use it everyday."
"February 6, 2017","fun"
"July 24, 2016","Great offering with Prime membership."

"December 11, 2016","Nope."
"November 11, 2016","Great music!"
"June 16, 2014","Need to allow for ""Artist"" tab. Too many songs to go through and by artist id much more convenient to sort by."
"April 27, 2016","Really cool features & very easy to work with. Great App!"
"August 24, 2016","Love it"
"November 26, 2014","Cant use it. Nothing you search for works, errors out, completely useless"
"December 6, 2016","Awsome"
"April 15, 2015","Keeps crashing on my phone. Terribly frustrated with it. Relatively sure this is what also messed up the messenger app on my Android phone."
"November 16, 2014","They said Hey! Now you get all this free music with your Prime membership trial! Unfortunately, the only way to listen to the music is to pay for online storage. Bah!"
"August 10, 2016","Their music selection is lacking."
"April 22, 2014","What is it everyone wants in a recording? Isn't it quality of product and reliability on the part of the seller. Well, I found both in my recent purchases. It leaves a purchaser with a feeling of satisfaction."
"January 11, 2015","Just when you think being an Amazon prime member can't get better, they come up with something new or more! This app I would recommend to AMYONE that loves music!"
"August 23, 2016","Pandora sucks, this app rocks!"
"July 1, 2016","I haven't been able to get it to work yet."

"December 1, 2016","Awesome"
"November 5, 2015","I really enjoy this app but the only think I've noticed was that my music Skips here and there."
"June 20, 2012","I can't figure out how to search the mp3 store through this app. All I can see is recommendations and browse by genre. To search, I have to use the browser and then I can't play the samples because my android tablet doesn't support the file type. This app is not listed as a choice of players when I download a sample."
"August 10, 2015","Love it!!!"
"August 17, 2016","Easy listening feel good music."
"August 17, 2016","Love the ease of using this app"

"January 27, 2016","I loved it, buying it on Friday! Best way to shop, read, listen to music!!!"
"November 24, 2016","The best"
"July 11, 2015","Unlike Pandora, I can add what songs I want to my own lists. I don't have to rely on the chance they know what they are doing."
"June 8, 2015","Haven't been using this long, but every group, album. Or song I have wanted is there. Really enjoy the heavy metal station! \m/"
"November 15, 2016","Awesome!!!"
"February 4, 2016","Lots of Playlists to choose from. Provides hours of commercial free music."

"May 14, 2016","Very easy to use and I like the option to buy music."
"June 18, 2014","Good Selection of Music. My main complaint is after listening, I can't figure out how to shut it down. Is there an on/off switch anywhere in this application so it does not run in the background?"
"February 26, 2016","well, I was totally amazed w/ the array of music that I can listened."
"November 18, 2016","Cool app."
"October 23, 2016","Can't beat it!!"
"November 27, 2016","Awesome"
"June 6, 2015","There's so many playlists to find and add to your collection, all for free! There's so many advantages to having Amazon prime!"
"July 31, 2015","just like it"
"October 22, 2015","I think Amazon Prime has a lot of good music and is cheaper than Slacker's best in the long-term."
"November 9, 2015","Great playlists. Just about everything you could ask for in a music service. Fits my needs."

"December 19, 2015","Solid music App... Fast downloads in account, great user seach... love it."
"July 31, 2014","I have used this on every Android device I have had for a while. I love the improved interface and now with Prime Music it is even better. I just wish it would go to landscape on my tablet"
"December 23, 2014","I love Amazon Music with Prime Music because I've never had a problem finding a song and most of them are free for me to listen to because I am a Prime member."
"June 15, 2014","This is the first time that I listened to music on my smartphone. I have had several smartphones but saw an ad regarding free music connected to my Prime account so I tried it out. Works Great!!!"

"September 22, 2016","Excellent No ads"
"September 3, 2015","I don't use it often with all the Pandora and Spotify options out there, but I do use it from time to time."
"June 26, 2014","The first song I wanted to play, as an Amazon Prime user, was by Supertramp (Give a Little Bit), and it was going to cost me... So, I don't know how frequently I'll be searching that service..."

"September 19, 2016","Best music app ever!!"
"August 28, 2016","Love the variety of music!"
"November 11, 2016","Very good"
"March 6, 2017","I try to be legit, but this is why piracy exists. If you're going to sell mp3s, don't require special apps to download or listen to your music. The more hoops you put your customers through, the least appealing the service becomes."
"May 23, 2016","Am very happy with Amazon Music. What a bargain."
"June 1, 2016","Service is great just what I expected and more"
"May 31, 2016","I love your x-ray lyrics and unlimited skips!!"
"October 9, 2015","Amazon Music brings me old school, R&B and the classics whenever & wherever I need them - AWESOME!"

"July 14, 2016","Nice selection, and unlimited skips!"
"October 18, 2016","So far so good"
"September 23, 2016","Great quality player"
"March 20, 2013","Have used this quite a bit in the last 2 months and getting the hang of the cloud. Of those resources out there this has been the most true to the intent. I've had to download some music direct as it can skip from time to time when in a building, but generally works the best."
"December 11, 2015","LOVE IT. Installed on all my devices Works great. Highly recommend for prime members"
"December 1, 2016","nice"
"December 9, 2014","Initially I was skeptical about it, but since it's an Amazon service I decided to try it...and try it I did, I'm just loving it...Amazon, you guys did it again."
"November 26, 2016","Great"
"January 19, 2016","Another crappy app that has wayyyy to many updates. Glitches. Crashes. Etc."

"July 4, 2016","I really do love it!! great selection~"
"June 20, 2014","So far I will give it 3 stars and see if it progresses into a real listenable station that can be used like Pandora or if everything I listen too must be purchased until the verdict is still out"
"April 12, 2015","It works, albeit somewhat confusing for using a credit: it does not show that you are using a credit until after you make your purchase."
"December 28, 2014","can't use all the features without 4.0. Customer service worked really hard with me though. Amazon customer service is #1 they need a app that goes with it."
"November 27, 2014","This application will give you nothing but trouble. I am so disappointed!"
"September 21, 2016","Ease, great choices,"
"August 6, 2015","Great!!!"
"June 19, 2014","I gave it 5 stars because prior to this I could not listen to my ITunes library on my android tablet. After uploading I now have access to my entire library with the added bonus of Prime Music."
"September 25, 2012","So - last year in May 2011 I got a Droid. Loved it but the music player is lame compared to iTunes. (Seriously? Google?) (I expect it from Microsoft - every MS Windows-based music player I have ever touched has been below lame.) I didn't care for Pandora - I like to play my music. I hadn't discovered Spotify yet. I jumped on the Amazon MP3 player with both feet! It was not snazzy but it is functional.  So I upload some of my music in the 5G of space they give us for free... then they say ""Hey!!! All music storage is FREE!! If it's MP3 then store it all here!!"" SO I UPLOAD the REST of my music.  I am a dinosaur so have CD's from the BEGINNING OF TIME. I have lots of friends in bands so there is lots of music that won't ever be for sale on Amazon. It is all ripped into iTunes - and on an old iPod Photo 60G. (The 4g iPod still lives - but due to an almost DOA battery is permanently docked to a clock radio in my bedroom.) So over the next few weekends I open the laptop, start the Amazon MP3 uploader and let it run. And run. And run. 9000 songs later I have most of my music in the Cloud. And then I start pulling it down to the Droid. (A Samsung Charge on Verizon - a nice phone - good reception with Verizon but watch for extras getting tacked onto your phone bill - ""City ID"" is one that is $2 a month for virtually nothing! oops!! I digress!)  After a month I was all done.  Then in August 2012 I get an email that Amazon is pulling support from their MP3 player for music I import beyond 250 songs (250 - how laughable! NOT!) ... unless I pay $24.95 a year?  Even though the price is reasonable - I still feel like - for the first time ever Amazon has done a BAIT AND SWITCH. When they said last year, 5Gigs is free - I used my allotment and no more. When they said ""It's free!"" I put some work into it and uploaded ALL of my music.  Because I thought it was going to be free FOREVER. Amazon was going to be in charge of my music storage and organization -- so my music would be safe. And the software would be functional and play with multiple vendors or providers - where ever my smartphone/tablet/thingamajiggy roads lead in the future..... FREE. I spent a month getting everything fixed. Perfect. The playlists cleaned up... Dupes removed. Song titles entered for those homemade CDs.... then I find find out Amazon has changed their mind - to the tune of $25 bucks a year just months later?  And somehow I have missed the window to get the music out of their stupid cloud. (I only traveled 25K miles last month, go figure!!) Now I have to re-rip some CD's that have already gone into one of the CD changers... I got to try and remember which albums I bought at music performances in the last year. I've got to GET RIGHT WITH GOD and Lucinda Williams about making sure I got all that woman's music on my permanently attached electronic-appendage. Adele is there. Lady Gaga is there. Where is Gillian Welch's 8 albums? Let see I have 2 Kelly Goodlad songs but am missing 4 more.... Do I really only own one Lenka song and one by Robyn? THIS IS PAINFUL. P-A-I-N-F-U-L. And that is just The Girls.... Wait until I start working on The Boys.  I am still mad almost two months later. Spelling words out - M-A-D-MAD? Yes. I am just that mad.  If I want to download the Music from the Amazon Cloud Drive - where all my music still resides in safety but where I can NOT PLAY IT - I have to do it one song a time.... And I cannot ""download"" an entire playlist. I cannot access my playlist. I cannot play my music on any computer in the world any where any time. I was sold one thing. It was free. I worked to that end. Now it is not free. I am usually not this cheap - promise. I am just that mad.  Two other complaints: I use a netbook most of the time. The Cloud player and the Cloud Drive's web interface are not respectful of the size limitations of the screen. The ""Artist"" column can not be expanded for example. You can't sort by Genre either. I got around this by creating Playlists in iTunes defined as: ""display all with genre = Rhythm and Blues"" -- but yea, now my playlists are gone unless I fork over $24.95. I can live with such out of free software. But if you charge money it better darn-tooting be nicely functional ok?  Last - the Droid App took over my phone and possessed it this past weekend. I was actually able to use the player on the phone still -- to go through and check what I had added recently. Afterwards I closed the App with the Task Manager. Then THE BIG BROTHERS at Amazon.com started Pushing a ""you must agree to this"" message every 10 minutes whether I was using the app or not. I seriously mean, I was on the phone with my mother and the phone dropped out and this Amazon Screen was displayed. I was playing Scrabble and the Amazon Screen took over. I was performing and recording the performance and the Amazon Screen took over and stopped the recording. I was reading Email and the Amazon Screen took over. At that point in time I deleted this app, the Amazon Marketplace app, the Amazon Price Checker app, the Amazon Student app, The Amazon shopping app.... And I seriously considered LEAVING THE AMAZON VINE PROGRAM and DELETING ALL MY REVIEWS and DELETING MY ACCOUNT HERE. COMPLETELY and TOTALLY.  Oh my!!! For the first time EVER. E.V.E.R. Amazon has got on my BAD SIDE.  Thank you for listening. I am sorry for this rant. I promise to be my normal, happy, down-to-earth self... next year sometime!!!  Yes. I am just that mad."

"August 28, 2013","Works great. I wish Amazon would increase the amount of upload songs (250 songs isn't very much) to the cloud; anything greater incurs a fee. That said, no problems - all is well!"

"December 10, 2015","I love how Amazon Music let's me listen to major new releases for free! Loving it."
"May 30, 2016","Works fine after I figure out how to use it."
"July 9, 2015","Music selection is great but interface is very clunky and not as easy as spotify. Playlist creation is also a chore."
"June 14, 2014","I don't have to download all my music to my devices. I can just click and go to my purchased music on my library or go to "" store"" and buy more if I am tired of and want something new."

"July 29, 2016","I use it everyday and like it."
"January 18, 2012","Awesome to get music from, great quality. But, when streaming (at least in Bangor, Maine) it chops out a lot more than I like from my ""Cloud"". Unusual as I use iHeart Radio, .977 and TuneIn Radio and stream with no problem. Look into that if you would AMazon. I will say that with downloaded content the quality is high. Thanks. B"
"March 5, 2014","I'd like to be able to make mp3 purchases from Brazil. Nowadays the only major mp3 store working from mobile phones in the country is Apple's iTunes Store. Please bring your store to Brazil so we can have choice."

"September 5, 2016","Love the Amazon Music"
"October 5, 2014","I like it. It works quite well. Sometimes an album is downloaded and there is no check mark. However, when you open up the album it shows the individual songs as checked."
"January 25, 2013","Should provide a greater selection of free music. Not accustomed to purchases songs on an individual basis. Advertised as a place to store up to 250 songs in the cloud, yet would not accept some of the songs stored on my computer and does not offer a great variety of free music."
"October 13, 2015","Great selection...not sure how to download music though...and not sure whats free or not free."
"December 18, 2014","Hey this is awesome. It works on my Ipod and my new OnePlus One phone. I can just plug either into my stereo amp and listen to streaming music. Awesome."
"September 29, 2015","Works great. Fills some gaps left by Pandora. This and Pandora round out my digital music needs"
"February 4, 2016","I'm thrilled. With Prime Music, I don't have to carry a bunch of CDs or mp3 discs to work to be able to change to the music that suits my mood at any given moment.  I love being able to listen on my phone or my computer without commercial interruptions. It's easy to Pause if my extension rings or if I have to concentrate on what I'm doing. I learned during Practicals in school (many, many years ago) that I work better with music, and I hope that Amazon Music with Prime Music will increase my productivity and the quality of same."
"August 30, 2016","Not good music options"
"January 19, 2016","Handy, easy to customize--and free with Amazon Prime! It's a great deal."
"November 6, 2014","Great feature if you have amazon prime. I'm listening to stuff I want to listen to. I read a review that said that all the ""good stuff"" you have to buy. I look at it like this. If you like an artist and there is one of their albums that you don't have then listen to it for free. If there is an album of theirs that you want to buy then buy it you are still supporting your favorite band or artist. Not everything can be for free."
"February 28, 2016","It is so convenient, any music you can imagine with easy access"
"May 20, 2015","Nice perk! I would like to be able to save stations, like on Pandora. It may be a feature and I just have to figure it out."
"August 6, 2015","Great"
"May 15, 2015","I love my amazon music ap. I can listen to so much music. I can even listen to my purchased for amazon music everywhere I go."
"January 18, 2016","Great music service that works anywhere. Fantastic value added to prime."
"July 3, 2014","It's a good start. Not much depth in music selection. Crashes video driver on Windows 7 on one of my systems. No downloads to local PC or laptop yet. Needs work but a decent first attempt."
"October 20, 2016","Good music"
"March 29, 2016","Love this app. Thanks for letting me listen on my phone"
"November 16, 2015","Amazing way to hear my favorite tunes while driving, at the gym or at home cleaning!!!"
"October 7, 2014","Amazingly easy to navigate and use right away. I'm hooked on the playlists and no matter what my mood, the selections are perfect. Thanks for making music so enjoyable."
"July 20, 2016","The artist is from my hometown."
"September 11, 2016","Awesome! I love it."
"October 15, 2015","I have used the service and am very happy with it. No problems so far and it is easy to use."
"October 11, 2016","Nice feature"
"October 24, 2016","It's okay"
"February 17, 2016","Too complicated to try and just simply download and pay for mp3s."
"August 30, 2015","Thought I could stream for free. Not finding that to be the case. Everything I want to hear had s cost."
"November 24, 2015","The Amazon Music App for Android use to be pretty cool. Recently I have found it to lock up after playing just one song and giving me an error #182. I use to love this app and streaming music that I purchased from Amazon. Since others are having this same issue, I am concerned that Amazon may have lost site of the need to play songs that I buy from them. I have sent many reports from the error screen. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted..you name it and I have done it. The install itself seems very glitch and not smooth like prior versions. All of this has been going on for a month."
"July 24, 2016","Lots of music to choose from!!"
"July 21, 2014","B.S.. downloaded this app only to find out my Kindle doesn't work with it. Way to go Amazon. Stiff a great customer just because I have no need in upgrading a perfectly capable device."
"November 5, 2014","The free prime was not the best part; the best part was that my entire Amazon collection I had already paid for could be tapped. It is a very easy app to use, too."
"August 23, 2016","Awesome. Fast Shipping"
"July 2, 2012","Amazon, you can do better. I like my album art. I want to see it while listening, not a dull gray UI. The app title and controls take away too much screen real estate. Even the store sucks and uses too much real estate for the app. Take a lesson from Google's music player.  Phone: Samsung Galaxy Note"
"August 29, 2015","Excellent, I love Gospel and this really help me through my day! I have not listen to nothing else yet."
"July 16, 2014","Amazing!!! Almost ready to get rid of Spotify and just run with Amazon Music, with my Prime Membership. Outstanding job to Amazon, they are surprising me everyday.  Thank you."
"May 31, 2015","MOST OF THE SONGS/ALBUMS I HAVE SEARCHED FOR HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND IT'S JUST ANOTHER PERK BEING AN AMAZON MEMBER."

"May 30, 2016","Amazon music has a large variety of music."
"May 30, 2016","AWESOME great music app totally enjoyable!"
"March 8, 2016","It has all the Songs and everything I need it Live on Amazon"
"December 22, 2012","Good app for purchasing music on the go and accessing my music on Amazon Cloud. The big disappointment for me is that I can't purchase albums with digital booklets. I don't know why digital music doesn't all include the booklets anyway, but that's an industry thing, I guess."
"December 1, 2015","Music stutters all the time. My other music services do not do this on my Nexus 6."
"August 13, 2016","Above average. Wide range"
"June 8, 2015","The app starts up right away and is always running. No matter how often it's stopped. Otherwise it's decent. Uninstalled"
"July 8, 2016","Excellent quality and great picks"
"September 15, 2015","Many songs I wanted weren't available. It also skips occasionally while listening - like it's a CD."
"June 18, 2014","App won't launch on my phone. Keeps saying that the phone needs to be set for a supported language such as English or French. The phone is set to English. French produces the same result."
"November 4, 2016","Thanks"
"April 24, 2012","It's great to have this player to access the music in your cloud. I use it a lot on long road trips. One huge complaint, however, is when I download music to my phone's SD card or create a playlist on my phone (as opposed to in my cloud). My music and playlists keep disappearing from my memory card!!! Very frustrating."
"September 20, 2016","Very easy to use"
"April 5, 2017","I have triple checked the compatibility but it errors out when I try to install. I had to write this review on a PC as it won't even allow me to review the app on my device until I have successfully installed it. So there's probably a whole lot of people out there in the same boat who can't review because they can't install."
"April 15, 2014","In order to work it forcing me to change language on my device (!). I think if device language is not supported by app, app should gracefully degrade to most popular languages - English or Chinese."
"May 14, 2015","I get all the songs I want with out any commercials or interruptions. I love this. I wish I would have known about it sooner."
"October 24, 2016","excelent"
"February 4, 2016","I would give a five start rating if there were a version for Linux."
"September 28, 2016","Easier options"
"January 13, 2016","Music sounds awesome but only concerns is the battery usage and crashes."
"November 6, 2015","Crazy selection! Absolutely love it! I love Prime period and this???!!! SMH. Bonus!!!!!"
"August 26, 2014","I""m loving this so far. I'm downloading a ton of good playlists for a camping trip this weekend that I will be off the grid for... Can't wait to listen to some great tunes!"
"July 20, 2015","Just started using. So far so good. Was a little tricky to figure out how to add music to the library at first."
"May 23, 2016","I can now listen to great music on my phone"
"January 3, 2016","This is a great value. And now you can download for offline listening"
"October 28, 2016","like it"
"September 23, 2016","Commercial Free"
"July 15, 2015","It's not only fun to look through the listed music but then you can sit back, relax and listen to music anytime."
"December 2, 2015","Amazon music is the best. I am so happy this and great deals makes Prime a value"
"September 22, 2016","Commercial free"
"May 22, 2016","Great way of obtaining music for my tablet."
"October 27, 2016","Awesome"
"November 9, 2015","Best way to enjoy Amazon Music. This takes away the playlist concept. Great Intuitive."
"July 22, 2016","love all the options for sure"
"July 31, 2015","Great"
"January 17, 2015","I hate this app! Bring back the mp3 player/downloader."
"February 20, 2016","I can take my music with me wherever I go. Great sound quality."
"June 18, 2014","What a great bonus to my Amazon Prime subscription. I've just started exploring the tracks, and playlist but have already found great music (Prince!) and lots of others. Thank you Amazon!"
"October 14, 2014","I was hoping that this Prime service would replace a lot of other services I was using through the Google Play market. At the time of this review, I am currently using a Prime membership trial. I was hoping that Prime membership could help me alleviate some other services by using it. For instance, I love Netflix but prime instant video seems to have everything I need. The free shipping options with Prime in the market also make it a good purchase decision. I use google play music now and for one flat rate I can listen to as many songs or albums from as many artists as I want without having to download or buy individual songs or albums and I can play and stream them directly from the Play service cloud. I can make as many playlists as I want too. When I checked through this Amazon music app, most of the music I wanted to listen to has to be purchased individually and most of the albums have to be done the same as well. I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on music. I will just stick with Google play music on this one. I believe they have it right. Still thinking of keeping Prime though. Just the shipping, Instant Video, and free book collection makes Prime worth it."
"May 12, 2016","Awesome selection and easy to use! Love it!!!"
"July 18, 2015","Very good music app, easy to navigate."
"December 13, 2013","this is a great app that can be used on all your gagets. cell phone,tablet, computer, your music is available anywhere you are. I use the player a lot. all your music purchases are there no worries about where your music is."
"May 30, 2015","So far, so good. It's great to have a Prime membership if this is some of the ""perks"" that come along with this."
"November 27, 2014","Descent app so far. Needs better and easier access to Amazon Radio."
"September 26, 2016","Good selection"
"November 26, 2015","It is an awesome app! Only thing iI noticed is it didn't have kip Moores new album"
"July 30, 2015","Great"
"June 22, 2014","I only checked this out briefly, but I didn't see any George Strait titles available. There was a ton of other good classic Country, though. Get George Strait and you get 5 stars from me."
"May 16, 2016","Nice, great música / Muy bueno, buena música"
"March 3, 2016","5 Star>. Prime...Music...Video...Discounts...Loyalty..."
"October 29, 2015","The Amazon music app is great for listening to music and is a really good music service."

"November 2, 2016","Great"
"July 16, 2016","Always a good source to go to."
"September 6, 2016","Not user friendly."

"February 4, 2016","Good overall, but having a little trouble with occasional drop out"
"June 26, 2014","I have been a prime member for years and this just makes the membership even more worth while. I have added so many songs to my Prime Music library that it's hard to choose what to play!"

"July 15, 2016","Great love it use it every day"
"November 6, 2015","Super easy to find good music. Love having music from my laptop now on my phone, too!"

"November 24, 2015","I love this app. I especially love that I can download songs straight to my phone."
"May 27, 2016","Not a big selection for my personal taste"
"August 6, 2014","This feature for some reason will not download onto my Kindle. Can't love it if you can't get it"
"June 14, 2014","I am an expat and bought many albums before moving to Canada. Very annoying that the app doesn't work on my Canadian phone, despite the fact that I still have a US address and credit cards."

"September 15, 2015","I like the choices and it has all the different kinds of music I like, and what ever mood I'm in."
"May 30, 2015","Absolutely love the fact I can download music and place it in a specific playlist all while still listening o the radio!"
"October 22, 2016","Like it"
"November 22, 2014","Good app for purchased music. It is kind of confusing to use in conjunction with Prime music. I recommend stick to purchases or stick to Prime with this app."
"August 6, 2015",":)"
"March 12, 2013","At best.  It's not sufficiently intuitive. It assumes your only source of music will be purchases made from Amazon. It lacks features. It drains the battery and send to be a memory hog.  Use it for downloading only and use your favorite music player."
"March 30, 2016","This is a really cool app. I love the lyrics feature."
"June 22, 2014","Possible improvement would be to identify songs you prefer and recommend new songs based on that. Still figure out the UI. Also, doesn't seem like this works on the Kindle Fire first gen."
"August 8, 2016","use it daily on my phone"
"October 7, 2015","Awesome!! I LOVE it!! Great selection....any song, artist, album or genre you can think of!"
"October 16, 2013","Amazon MP3 gives me the ability to purchase one, two tracks, or an entire album all a price greatly reduced from their CD counter parts. This together with Amazon's Music Cloud is a perfect way to make sure that no song is ever lost."
"October 3, 2016","Awesome app"
"February 9, 2016","I find really good music on it. it's easy to download .thank you"
"January 31, 2016","Works great for me. I like the old music And they have a lot."

"April 10, 2015","Love that there are so many free option . And prices are decent. Plus I can pick just a song from an album or buy the whole album."
"March 2, 2016","Love it, but could use a few more artists in Christian rock"
"July 24, 2016","listen to it while workout!"
"August 17, 2016","This app has a LONG way to go. But it's all you can use with Prime music. Searching for music comes up with lame knock-off remixes, and bands instead of the original artists. That is SO LAME. Also, there is NO EASY WAY to setup preferences to NEVER EVER find and/or playback explicit lyrics! Completely hazardous to family values. I would say that most people do NOT want to hear music that sings F_CK and B_ITCHES and MOTHERF_CKER all the time. Do NOT listen to ""RnB"" music on Amazon unless you like hearing the F word 1000 times per work day."
"April 22, 2016","I listen to old rock. They have great selection."
"May 23, 2016","Love,love,love. Can even listen off-line."
"July 8, 2014","Entire my family enjoy this feature. Since I have no time to convert from CD with budget, this is the best service they offer top of AMAZING customer service and other Prime benefit."
"June 1, 2016","I am new to this. But so far I love it!"

"December 18, 2014","I love Prime!! However big thumbs down that it won't let me listen to my Play store music. Play store allows me to listen to my purchased Amazon music."
"July 31, 2016","It is not user friendly!!"
"September 6, 2015","I like their choices. Just wish I could figure out how to use this. It's really confusing to me."
"March 4, 2016","Would be nice if some more of less current hits were free."

"October 9, 2016","Great app"
"January 23, 2016","Reminds me of WNUA the Smooth Jazz radio station we had in Chicago."
"February 21, 2015","The only thing I wish is that the Library music could be downloaded. I live in the sticks and lose signal while driving quite a  bit."
"December 16, 2014","This is one of my favorite benefits of my Amazon Prime membership. There is so much free music to listen to that makes a music lover's heart all giddy!"
"July 22, 2014","So excited about this. I have an extensive music collection but haven't downloaded to my phone. This was so easy in no time at all I have hundreds of my favorites ready to enjoy."
"October 3, 2016","OK for now"
"March 29, 2016","It okay but it needs a larger labirary latin music"
"May 10, 2013","I like the convenience of being able to listen to my amazon MP3 purchases from other devices, but I found that it takes a lot of memory to run and often times has to pause and buffer, even in good coverage areas. I mainly use it in my car on my android phone,"
"March 11, 2016","Simply Awesome and Amazing! I'm hooked! Thanks Amazon!"
"June 18, 2014","I love this music. There are so many choices that are offered. Too many to choose all at once. I love that being a Prime member gets me free music. I listen while I am on my PC. Thanks AMAZON."

"June 3, 2015","Junk. No selection to speak of. Unless you like artists who aren't good enough to sign with real record companies."
"November 26, 2014","Not nearly enough variety of choices with their current library. Luckily, Amazon Music is just another perc to being a Prime member, just not a big one."

"June 20, 2014","Just started playing with Amazon prime's music streaming feature and it's totally addicting. I've added dozens of songs to my playlists, and it's all included with my prime membership"

"May 30, 2015","Downloaded a lot of music, which was great but it disappeared when I didn't renew my prime...I didn't like that. KP"
"July 14, 2016","Lately, I've been listening to my Prime Music collection almost every night. I would give it five stars, except that there are some artists and songs that are slow to make it to the collection. Some of my old favorites from the 70's / 80's / 90's were in my original collection, but then were pulled out (i.e., Neil Young) and not available for ""free"" (I pay for Amazon Prime, so it's not exactly free).  Just figured out how to download songs from my playlist to my cell phone to play offline. This will come in handy to play in the car, since my radio is on the fritz. Must have tunes when driving! I just bought a holder for the phone so that I will be able to hear the music and advance through the selections hands free.  Streaming quality is great. I like the suggestions for other songs I might like. Could use more indie selections."
"May 21, 2016","Needs better radio station selections."
"July 2, 2014","No, really, I've tried loading it on my BlackBerry twice now, and all I get is a black screen. But Amazon has never cared about BlackBerry users anyway, so I shouldn't be surprised."
"April 1, 2015","Great on android tablet or phone, but not so great on the computer. All in all, it's a great feature, playlists are really nice."

"April 6, 2016","Limited selection in music. Not worth your time."
"March 7, 2016","I like it but feel the selection is verrrrrrry limited"
"December 10, 2014","Once you have figured out the app it is a great app. My one issue would be not able to listen to prime stations, however I am able to on my computer."
"February 2, 2014","This app flawlessly delivers 50% of the Amazon cloud-based multimedia world. In order to rate any higher, it would also need to address Prime video as well, but alas, Android and Prime video are incompatible."

I had to pull the battery to reboot the phone.  >> Update << Latest update (October, build 2.0.13) fixed the problem, works fine now. Thanks for listening, Amazon."

"August 28, 2016","Really cool."
"June 18, 2014","Better than Pandora as far as can tell. Better control of playlists. Just started so I can say more the longer I use it. We do need more perks for the increase in Prime membership."
"August 28, 2016","Easy to use."
"September 6, 2016","Works well"
"March 10, 2015","I enjoy using this app. Great for android users. They keep expanding their library so there will hardly be a song you can't find."
"April 27, 2016","only thing lacking is a larger selection"
"September 6, 2016","Love IT!!!"
"May 9, 2016","meet my expectation.great amazon apps"
"July 18, 2015","I found a lot of older music on prime that they let you download and keep ..I was pleasantly surprised"
"April 16, 2015","This app is pretty cool as along as your a prime member. You get access to all kinds of music and you can personalize it."
"May 15, 2015","Such promise and yet delivers so little. This app plays 1 song and then just stops. Not very useful if you ask me."
"November 13, 2015","I stream from this service regularly. I like the quality and the selection."
"September 4, 2016","Good app.."
"September 17, 2016","Not bad"

"December 2, 2015","I love being able to search up different styles of music based on mood."
"February 21, 2016","Errors all the time. Deletes library during upgrades."
"August 18, 2013","Easy to use and install, works better than other music apps I've tried, and you can't beat the price-free. I use it not just for tunes I purchase through Amazon but also songs I've down loaded from other sites. All and all a good deal"
"November 7, 2014","I have a mac perhaps that is why it is so hard to work with this. I may need to convert to mp3 just so I can record onto a CD to sing with my friends."
"February 15, 2015","I've tried Amazon music here and it didn't even come close to Spotify on any level. Sucks too because I use Amazon everything else."
"February 3, 2016","This is very nice. Convenient and lots of genre choices."
"September 5, 2016","Very good"

"February 19, 2016","Makes it easy to access my prime library on my phone."
"May 12, 2016","Met and went beyond my expectations"
"May 30, 2016","Pretty okay. Works well enough."
"May 3, 2016","Why use addora when you can use this?"

"March 3, 2016","Want alphabetical and wish certain songs were free"
"December 9, 2014","The presentation is very nice, and the player is easy to use. However I use Linux on my computers and there is no uploader available for Linux."
"June 26, 2015","I am enjoying this feature of Amazon Prime for the first time and I have been a member for several years."
"April 29, 2015","Great way to listen to music anywhere I go. There's still a need for mood based Prime playlists, that would be a hit."
"April 19, 2016","I love this its got all kinda good music"
"August 25, 2016","Enjoy music"
"August 20, 2016","Awesome App!"
"February 11, 2015","I keep trying to delete songs, but they keep showing up under recently downloaded. If not for that issue, I would give it 5 stars."
"December 8, 2015","I appreciate the ability to copy my music to other media and devices."
"September 11, 2016","love it"
"November 24, 2015","Doesn't have chrome support. Common Amazon stop being an up tight prude!"
"July 16, 2012","Mostly shovels albums($10+ USD), and then a few tracks at a time for $0.99 USD.  Missing ALMOST EVERYTHING of what I'd like, kinda sad for a digital brokerage, although I'm sure that the M*FF*AA played the MAJOR role in that. Hey they gotta make money off their shit talent somehow..."
"April 25, 2016","I don't know other sites but it works good."

"December 2, 2015","I like it. Not the best selection, but no commercials makes up for it."
"January 6, 2015","Not a very friendly user interface. Takes too long to figure out how to properly use. Has only playlists, so you cannot create channels."
"May 23, 2016","I love the with my prime I can put my songs on the cloud free and don't have to listen to random selections, just what I want to hear when I am in the mood for it. It's perfect for those of us with mood based music selections. If I want to listen to Spanish rap one minute then switch to pop country the next I can. Thank you Amazon!! Love the prime benefit!"
"January 29, 2016","I like because I can music i havent heard in a long time."
"September 5, 2016","Love it!"
"July 13, 2015","I love the way it seamlessly blends the music on my computer with the items available in Prime Music."
"July 27, 2014","I wish I could give a better rating. Will not install on my S4 phone. I have had experts try and they came to the conclusion that there is something wrong with the app."
"August 9, 2016","It works well."
"August 14, 2015","I was just looking for a music app. I didn't want prime, but apparently it is part of the app."

"October 7, 2015","Good music no comercials. Not easy to build you own radio station. Just playlists."
"June 30, 2016","Everything is well done"
"November 12, 2015","AMAZON HAS HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK AGAIN - WHY WOULD YOU GO ANYWHERE ELSE ?"
"September 3, 2016","Great!!!"
"November 21, 2015","Amazon selects the best music by category...I have discontinued Pandora."
"November 19, 2014","So far this does now disappoint. A very vast variety of music at my fingertips and a great amount of free albums and songs as well! I am very happy"
"July 16, 2015","Havn't had too many selections of music so far. Any music I want, I still have to buy to listen to."
"July 3, 2016","It Totally Rocks!!!!!!"
"October 15, 2015","Too many permissions required, so I won't download/use it.:( Very disappointing."
"January 31, 2016","Cool place to have your music at the click of the mouse."

"May 4, 2013","After going through all the steps and installing the program, when I try to download my first music which was free, It was mandatory to enter credit card info. How about letting us know first about the credit card. I deleted the whole program."
"November 12, 2015","Use it all the time and love it. Amazon has all the music you every need!"
"December 24, 2014","Good selections and the offered playlists are getting better. After all, this is still a new product for Amazon. For me, it beats Pandora"

"October 2, 2015","Pretty good"
"August 11, 2016","It was great"
"August 16, 2015","I love Amazon music channels. My son turned me on to it. The best part is no commercial ad."
"June 28, 2014","Albums don't show up, the UI became an ad for Prime; even if you have Prime it won't go away. Amazon continues to fail at their cloud service making it worse with every step."

"August 30, 2016","Love it"
"December 13, 2012","It performs well, and being able to access the cloud across multiple devices is really nice. It needs to have the option of storing purchased content on an SD card rather than on the device's internal memory. Aside from that, it performs very well and worth downloading."
"August 30, 2016","awesome"
"November 12, 2015","I love the app but wish I could get it on my Samsung smart TV. Hint hint"
"October 11, 2015","Only old music, nothing current and I can't download stations for offline play."

"July 17, 2013","There are many other MP3 players on the market that are much more stable and reliable than Amazon's. It's a shame Amazon can't get this more stable as my family only purchases music from Amazon and it'd be nice if streaming music was a lot more reliable. As it stands I just download all the MP3s we buy and put them on my SD card."

"October 5, 2012","The no limit music storage is killer. I have nearly 50000 songs and amazon mp3 is the only cloud that allows unlimited music storage (that I know of) and 50gb of space for your files other than music. And all this only costs 20$ a year. It's incredible! I love my amazon mp3."

"October 24, 2011","I love Amazon, and the Amazon more store is fantastic, but this app isn't as good as I'd like. The interface is nice and easy to use, but the loading of the media library is excessively long and often triggers several freezes and force closes. I hope there is an update some day that makes it as great add it should be."

"October 22, 2015","I think has great selection of music for all ages and groups of people."
"June 24, 2014","My favorite music (60s and 70s rock) cost a lot of money. Free versions are tribute groups of unknown quality. Didn't see a single free song by the original bands. LAME"

"October 27, 2012","Can't really say much about this app, except that it would not work on my HTC Evo Design 4g. Downloaded and installed a couple times and when I tried to open, all I got was a blank screen, This may work well on some other phones but I was unable to make it work on mine."

"November 8, 2015","Whole family loves selection on Amazon Prime Music."
"December 1, 2014","I was skeptical at first, but after a phone call to customer support they helped answer my questions. #1 I thought I made a mistake when I downloaded my first 10 albums to my phone thinking I had spent 150 accidentally on music... This is what I learned. Prime is nice because any prime song can be put on the cloud or saved to your device for free. I was after an option that would not take up all my phones memory, but still allow me to have music on the go with or without Internet access. The songs with price tags are not free. The songs with the prime symbol are. So not every song you desire will be free but a good majority of my selection was. I have 178 songs so far and only spent about 5 dollars purchasing some songs that weren't prime approved. In response to my #1 experience I ended up paying .99 for the one song that was not prime out of the albums."
"August 26, 2014","It all makes perfect sense to me , buddy boy. I don't like it and my review will stay the same until I figure it out. Samsung galaxy tablet"

"May 30, 2016","Great!"
"April 1, 2016","Cool add on to Prime."

"September 8, 2015","So happy I moved into the 21st century and tried Prime Music!!"
"October 31, 2014","Ive been useing Amazon MP3 for years and have used it as my primary music player for four diffent phones ive used since the iPhone 3. The iPhone 3s 64gig is where I downloaded it first. Loved it on the HTC Sence and kinda miss it. Then I upgraded to a Galaxy Note 3 which was also wonderful and easily integrated with the device.  I now use a LG smartphone. Interestingly when I set up my new phone I logged into my google account and my ohine automatically downloaded all the apps I had previously installed... except Amazon MP3. It was just gone.  Today I went to install the new Music app and stopped short at the privacy screen. Good g-d!  I went back and read some reviews and it looks like I am not alone as far as being disappointed.  DRM free music and general un censored control of my music is what wone me over back in 2007/2008  Removing the option to save music and cover art to my external sd card is a huge deal. I want control.  I accidentally figured out how to install the darn app only after accidentally figuring out how to install the prime video player extension to the Amazon app.  It too damn hard to find for me and im somewhat savvy. Someone over there (maybe even sevral) needs to get there head out of there own doggy dish and render this app useable again.  Relax the permissions and security it's just too much. I had to override my phones security to allow untrusted apps to have near full control of all my data. I call bulshit.  Pandora had become redundant and boring. Sootify crashes my browser and is unreliable iheart radio and last fm were also not good enough for me to change my routine. And now Amazon MP3 has gone all prism on me... sad.  After 5 blissful years I want a divorce. Unfortunately for you I'm keeping the kids and their allowance. The whole family is now addicted to Google Play Music where we can search nearly artist song or radio stream and be listening in seconds. Its also much easier to purchase music and movies via the play store as well.  Sometimes Amazon just needs get out of their own way, and take my money."
"October 15, 2015","I use it on my laptop and on my phone. Love this app."

"December 31, 2012","I tried to download this because none of the MP3's I've bought from Amazon will play on any of the players I have on my android tablet but I can't get this thing installed either - waste of time and/or money to buy the player and the music"

I like to update software on my device, and sometimes that process requires that I uninstall and reinstall applications... imagine my surprise when suddenly I find I am locked out of my Amazon digital music because my I am only allowed to install 10 Amazon Music registrations, and instead of automatically removing unused registrations, I suddenly have none.

"October 15, 2015","Excellent feature for Prime users."
"March 14, 2012","I love absolutely LOVE it because it's NOT i Tunes. I hate having to buy music threw a company that will only let me listen to it on their devices (without jumping threw hoops to download it).  Amazon accepts most of my current library & let's me purchase music at the same or better rate as competitors. Another of my favorite features is the fact that the upload & download system is a smooth & seamless process (oh the frustration i tunes have caused me over the years).  Another great feature is the format- MP3's, rather than one format that can only be used in that company's devices. Being such a universal format it's much easier to use in all kinds of devices.  Having everything on the cloud is great too. I don't have to use up my devices' memory & I get the same [music] on all my devices with only doing the work of adding to one. That also means no more, ""which device is that song on?""!  I LOVE IT!"
"February 28, 2016","good"
"January 27, 2016","Great music"
"May 15, 2015","I buy albums and songs and can't download them! No refunds either!"

"May 30, 2015","Love it! Buying Prime is the best purchase I've made this year."
"October 19, 2013","I have installed the cloud player on all my devices, which was easy and no issues encountered. Able to play my music any where. If you like music then you will like this!"
"June 18, 2014","A little difficult to navigate. Wide variety of music and prompt downloads. Better to have a wireless connection for downloads."
"July 9, 2015","I would give it 5 stars if it would work on my xbox one"
"July 9, 2015","I only wish there were 4 to 6 hours of music at a time."

"January 3, 2016","Keep them coming"
"February 8, 2016","👍👍👍👍"
"November 8, 2016","Wanted to love this, I really did. I love all things Amazon and the music selection and service with prime are good so I was excited to try the music unlimited. Unfortunately, the app itself skips constantly. I literally can't get through one single song without a skip. These are downloaded songs on TWO different phones, a Galaxy S3 and S5 so it's a streaming/connection issue either. App updates, cache clearing and restarts have not fixed it. It happens on both phones so it must be a problem with the app itself since it's the only faulty media experience on either. It makes the listening experience unbearable so I will be cancelling the free trial and looking elsewhere. It's a real shame they can't make this product work correctly."
"December 29, 2015","A good investment"
"April 19, 2015","Makes me so glad I'm a Prime member, totally awesome, thanks Amazon!!!!"

"February 2, 2016","LOVE IT!!"
"August 31, 2015","Amazon Prime has most of my favorite songs."
"January 14, 2013","Do you have a phone on which you listen to music? Do you buy music from Amazon? Then you need to get this. It's a well designed program for getting your Amazon Music purchases to your phone. And the player is...acceptable. It plays music, and doesn't glitch up trying to do it.  However, the more you use the player, the more you'll find it's not all you want. You'll listen to an album, and then it'll just stop; it won't keep playing to the next album in your library. The interface is straight forward, but just slightly off somehow. You'll want to do one thing, and you'll accidentally do another. You'll never have a MAJOR problem with the media player, but it's not the perfect answer.  If you want something with tons of options and personalization, look elsewhere for your music app. If you're looking for a way to get your Amazon purchases to your phone, and a perfectly acceptable player for those songs, stop right here."
"December 4, 2014","LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! so many options and with amazon prime, so many FREE songs and playlists <3"
"January 4, 2014","This autorip and the MP3 cloud = Awesome!! I downloaded it and every cd i ever bought from amazon was there! The only work I had to do was download the app!"

"January 23, 2016","I got this app to use with a Bluetooth speaker. So far, I've only been streaming music, but it's fantastic for that. I can access my personal playlists easily. Amazon playlists are just as easy to access, navigate and choose by genre and mood. Even better, if I like a song on one of Amazon's playlists, I can add it to my personal playlist with just a couple of touches. I've found Amazon Music for Android even easier to use than the version for PC. Good job, Amazon."

I do not use its player or any of the other features. I dont like that it wants me to subscribe to prime, but at least it only asks once. I dont like that it starts at boot, and I dont like that some other non-amazon related things seem to wake it up. I really wish developers would stop with that nonsense"

Since the change, all the hours I spent downloading have been pretty much wasted. Music I uploaded to cloud works mostly but downloads are not working. So... no listening to music in the woods when I'm drawing. No in the truck traveling. It was the major reason I signed up in the first place. Kinda bummed."

"December 3, 2015","Great selection"
"March 8, 2013","The app insists on keeping any downloaded files on internal memory and not on the SD card. There's no configuration option for changing the library location.  While the application has settings that claim to limit downloads to Wi-Fi only, and to not automatically download new purchases, my experience has been that the application does NOT respect these settings. I learned this when I found my phone downloading a Handel box set I'd purchased, eating up the remaining internal memory on my phone and using my T-Mobile data plan to do it. If I wasn't paying for unlimited data this bug would have cost me a few hundred megs in overage charges. I tried pausing the active download, but the application kept chugging along, giving me no way to STOP the downloads.  The application can't be trusted to do what you tell it to do. A search through the support site reveals Amazon has no apparent plans to fix these problems. If you install it, be sure to have an unlimited data plan, or you WILL eventually get hit with a large data overage charge from your mobile carrier.  I'm going to try and find a resolution for these bugs, but if I can't find one I'm uninstalling the application."
"October 9, 2015","Your variety is incredible!"
"September 25, 2015","Lots of music to choose from."
"July 22, 2015","There are many wat better choices out there!"
"April 11, 2017","If you do a lot of purchasing from Amazon, especially music downloads, you may want to consider getting this app. I use this site to download all my digital recordings I get from Amazon onto my phone's MP3 player. For someone like me who is not very technological Amazon Music is easy to maneuver around in and create playlists to put your music downloads in. In other words if I can use this anyone can! LOL!"
"September 7, 2013","It stores all your music from amazon so it is always available now I have it in my computer and my android,"
"March 25, 2015","Why should I have to download another music player for this service?"

"October 29, 2015","Great music selection."
"May 9, 2011","Works well overall, however, the playback stops when receiving an incoming text message and doesn't resume after the notification tone is played. Does not exhibit this behavior with incoming calls (pauses and resumes just as it should), just texts."
"January 12, 2017","For over a month now, ""Amazon Music"" has a bug where the New Releases section in the ""Store"" - Not Prime... only shows music from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, etc.. I can't see what's new and listen to previews of new music before purchasing, because nothing from this side of the globe is even on there! This needs to be fixed. No wonder so many people get their music for free via Torrents, when our choices to PURCHASE and control our own music libraries are piss poor. Greed in the streaming only game is pathetic, and you can only push people so far. FIX THIS BUG!"
"August 20, 2014","Straight from her heart. One of the most gut-wrenching blues songs I have ever heard. It will blow you away."

Which is word taking into account that everything else related to amazon in the phone is working. After uninstall and reinstall no changes. Let's see what happen with customer service."

All genres R covered, classical, new age, country, alternative,etc. even explicit rap tunes &kids stuff. I cant say how well selection is 4ea but looks like in general theres a ok 2good amt free, including recent releases. Theres also PRIME playlists U can stream or download w/categories from ""rock"" or ""rap"" yr workouts & classical 4reading, soothe baby, etc.1st music app I've had was iTunes so incomparison w/buying everything 4stars.. ITunes does have quite the selection so -1 4that! 2nd app I've used &most recent was Google play so, I'm probly biased but I liked format, listing top songs, related artists, which amazon sorta does &artist mini bio which amazon doesn't. Plus Google play $9.99mo unlimited, so I was inclined 2stay but as Prime member thought I'd check it out. Prime perks R 5star, where else is it free despite limited selection. Miss monthly subscription pymt on Google or any other type app &U got jack 2listen 2even if U bothered downloading, free on amazon so far has proven 2b free."

"June 4, 2015","I have the same problems with response that people have noted-I have a massive collection in my music library(134K songs and I exect to max it out-I overbought CD's over the years).  I like the interface, but when I go to search for an artist (even with a name like Todd Rundgren) the search takes several minutes. I assumed this was due to the amount of songs I have uploaded, but the same search on the Amazon Echo app takes a second or two. My response time on my iPad is even worse, but the Echo app for iPad is instant.  Not sure what the issue is, but if Amazon were able to make searches go quicker, this would be a five star rating. When people ask how satisfied I am with streaming through Amazon, I feel obligated to mention the painfully slow search time."
"November 3, 2013","Easy to access and manage music library this is coming from a non technically savvy guy. I am using this site to manage my play lists as a spin instructor."

That sounds like a very convenient change to promote Prime membership only. I had planned to purchase more songs using my amazon card balance but now it appears I will have to use I tune music app. instead . Sorry for the inconvenient change that was made.

A little high on price for some of the songs and albums you have to pay for. Also I have found that some of the selections don't let you know that the songs are for karaoke so there are no vocals in the music just the instruments. And you don't find out until after you download it."

Not possible. The ""upgraded"" player is terrible! It locks up my Asus tablet, cannot find my downloaded music - even the music I've purchased from Amazon and will not play my playlists.  Geez, Amazon! I shop with you all the time! Do u really need to gouge me for more money?  I'll be downloading everything from my Amazon cloud and using the Google player."

"November 3, 2014","Like others have said, I too consider this the absolute worst application I have ever used. Why, Amazon, have you made this so difficult? I have spent 25 years in IT, and believe me when I say, this is the most frustrating and non-intuitive application I have ever used. The only way I have found to use this is to download it to my computer first and then copy and paste the songs/albums to my Android device!! Really?? In this day and age?? Did you not test this before dumping this on us?? I have other problems with this thing, too, but I just don't have the time to go into it, and besides, I am not here to be your beta tester and right now, this is worse than beta software."

"June 18, 2014","The layout is not user-friendly if you are using this in any sort of a mobile/non-Kindle fashion. This is apparently designed for people sitting at home reading their Kindles. Fine, but I feel like I've lost a useful app in the revision.  In the previous app version: it was pretty simple to use while in car or exercising (listening whilst in motion). You now have to stop, go to additional screens (with small screens/touchpoints-even by mobile standards!), & take extra steps to accomplish fairly easy functions (get playlist on device, shuffle, repeat song, etc.). Unacceptable from both a safety (car) &/or usability standpoint (exercise).  When you buy an MP3 from Amazon while mobile (eg: hear a song in a store that you like)- it STILL loads it to the internal memory. (!!!) My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it's an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.  Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles. Great if you're sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.  The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions. (This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is).  Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade. OH....SOoooo not happy about that. I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I (now know that I) should have backed them up. I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists (not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc.). Am not happy about this.  I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime. (I don't sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi). When I'm on a road trip- it's my bandwidth that's used if so. I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I don't need to use bandwidth to listen. Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation. If I'm at home, fine.  But it simply doesn't serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up. What do I gain here by using this app? Whatever I do gain- it's incremental/likely not worth the additional effort. Amazon's late to the game on this.  Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I won't be using their app (won't be running across products to buy)."

"July 28, 2016","I love Prime Music. Very convenient. Huge catalog, with great quality and variety of artists available. Didn't think I'd use it much... but it has become one of my favorite parts of the Amazon Prime experience. I stream it via wifi through my phone to a large bluetooth speaker for parties outside. I listen with headphones on my laptop. I use it on my larger PC system when I'm working. I download favorite artists to my phone, then listen later via bluetooth on my car stereo (no data overage!). I use it on my Echo for light music at dinner time."

"February 10, 2014","I liked the cloud feature and the it was free (unlike the Google music app that came with my tablet)"
"April 5, 2011","It's a decent player, though it would be nice if you could mix the cloud and local tracks. Also, the way that it hijacks the controls is inconsistent...needs to be a setting to make sure that it acts the way you want. I had to uninstall because it just ate my battery and when I killed it, it started itself back up again. I'll be glad to look again once those two things are fixed."
"May 4, 2015","Great"

An entire Matt Hires album now says every song is titled Glorious by David Archuleta, several of my George Strait songs are titled The Pretender by The Foo Fighters, and a Steve Moakler album is How Far We've Come by Rob Thomas. Now mind you these are all songs I purchased on amazon. I don't even know what other songs I can't enjoy because they've been mislabeled and I can't find them.

"August 27, 2014","Not much music by original artist."
"February 13, 2013","HATE is not a strong enough word to describe how I feel about Amazon MP3 cloudplayer app. The only way to get it to download is to go into settings, deselect auto download, select it again, and then wait 5 minutes to see if anything is happening on your phone. The app itself doesn't indicate that any download is happening or eminent. I hate everything associated with Cloud. Compare the Audible App, which works in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download, it starts the download and gives you a progress bar. What the hell could be more simple? But that's too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blows. I absolutely HATE it, & it makes me HATE Amazon."

"January 12, 2015","I absolutely LOVE Amazon Music! As a PRIME member, I have access to a boatload of music that I can listen to at any time, for free! I can create my own playlists, or save some awesome playlists that have already been created by Amazon. If you can think of a genre, Amazon Music has it.  True, you can't download songs, but if you want to do that, you should pay for those songs.  I also love the fact that many of the songs have lyrics, so (unfortunately for my family), I can belt out tunes to almost any song.  And if you have Fire TV...instant karaoke! The lyrics appear on your tv! Love, love, love!"

"June 9, 2016","Prime music impressed a friend and myself while listening to one of the playlists. We were both pleasantly surprised to hear many ""album cuts"" of songs that did not make Top 40 radio. The song repeat rate is much lower than a competing service I had subscribed to. It's easy to create custom playlists and add music to your library. I was skeptical of the Prime Music offering when Amazon introduced it but have come to realize it is not just a side venture; rather it is a extensive offering of music and artists."

"December 17, 2014","Love it"
"November 19, 2016","Loved it at first. It was pre-installed bloatware on my Note 5 but since I was a Prime member I started using it. Lots of great music, easy to build play lists. Trouble is that the app got to a point where it needed an update but every time I attempt to update it failed. This is true of the Kindle app as well. Per some Amazon and Android forums I cleared my app cache, no change, Uninstalled and attempted to reinstall. Now the app cannot install at all. I hit generic Android errors and there are no good fixes that I have found on any Android or Amazon search. Downloading from Google Play or Amazon App Store makes no difference. That said, it may not be fair to rate the App so low when it's possibly an OS issue but other downloaded apps are behaving normally."

"September 5, 2014","There are many popular songs that are unavailable. You can not download any songs to your computer hard drive, you have to work in the cloud. If you find a song that you like you may have to pay for it. I guess I had the wrong idea about it. I thought all songs would be free and available to do anything that I wanted to do with them. This is not the case, it seems to be very restrictive. So as you peel back the layers of the onion, its not all its cracked up to be."
"January 23, 2013","Nice this is available. Setting it up on different devices is a bit time consuming. Every purchase should be available."

"March 28, 2013","This was my ""go to"" music player on my phone. I liked it more than any other, and I purchased music from Amazon on occasion. But then it started to say that it couldn't play music on my device. So I investigated, and Amazon changed the game. Now you have to pay $24.99 a year for their service. Don't get me wrong, if you want a cloud service, that's a decent deal. I just wanted a good music player on my phone for music that is already on my phone. That's all. For giving me a nice player, they got my business when I needed to purchase a song. But that is gone, and I switched to Google Play Music. It will do. I don't like it as much yet, but I haven't used it long. And now they will make the money when I decide to buy a song. I completely deleted the Amazon app from my phone."

"June 20, 2014","There is absolutely no mention that this new Prime Music Application will not work with the 1st Generation Kindle Fire. After screwing around with my Kindle for hours I spent another hour on the phone talking a total of four people from Amazon before I was finally told "" your device is not compatible with this update and you need to buy a new Kindle"". WTF!!!! I am very disappointed with Amazon and the deliberate omission of this piece of very important information. If you are monitoring this Amazon, you dropped the ball and I will buy an Apple Ipad before I spend another dollar on any of your devices."

"September 19, 2014","Excellent app"
"September 19, 2014","Enjoyable app"
"December 28, 2011","I like being able to use Amazon MP3. Not a fan of the cloud player because it uses my limited data. And I wish they hadn't taken away the free song of the day."
"September 29, 2014","easy to use"
"October 30, 2014","Great"

"October 31, 2014","good"
"October 4, 2014","Great app"
"November 25, 2012","It is hard to download purchased mp3s to my phone. The web page design prevented fully seeing the options and buttons."
"October 28, 2016","Klunky, frequent user interface lockups and crashes, and can't play songs without hiccupping, pausing, and crashing - and that's just from downloaded, local storage on my phone! Considering that playing a local audio file has been done smoothly by PCs since about 1988, this is a big disappointment. If it wasn't required to utilize my Amazon Prime music, I would ditch this one in a heartbeat. I have already wasted too many minutes of my life working with this app."
"July 6, 2012","Downloads apps slowly and continuous errors towards end of downloads. What more can I say, some technical tweaking is definitely needed."
"August 31, 2014","Worth the money"
"April 24, 2013","This app is quick and easy to use. I would recommend it to everyone. I can find what I want fast."

"July 10, 2013","If you learn how. To work it its fine, I did expect more I use it but not that much"
"June 24, 2017","I love Amazon music for certain music. Not at all for my Christian music. Not much of a selection. I love this one singer named Hilary Weeks but there is only one of her albums. I do like I can listen to all of Joey&Rory's music, Christian and county. Very poor when it comes to LDS singers."
"January 30, 2013","It is all I expected it to be, and more! Now I can access my music on my computer, tablet and smart phone!"
"September 6, 2014","No comment."
"September 11, 2014","Love this!"
"November 3, 2011","I love being able to access my cloud drive music, but unfortunately the app now regularly and randomly closes, making it very frustrating, and not very usable."

"August 2, 2014","I don't want to."
"July 22, 2014","Skips periodically"
"August 29, 2014","Great music"
"February 7, 2013","The number one benefit of this music app for me is the ability to sync music to multiple devices easily with a wifi signal. That was my criteria for choosing this type of app. I like that we can play the music by accessing the amazon music cloud and not just by downloading each song on my kindle as long as I have wifi. I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space. There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is ok but not great. How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service. The music streams seamlessly from the app or the cloud when playing, as well"
"July 15, 2014","fast and good price"
"February 26, 2013","I liked download. very useful and was good to use. met my needs and is worth the use. thanks amazon."

"December 5, 2012","if you want to order MP3 music on your android phone this works great. I assume Amazon thinks so and I do too."
"August 23, 2014","Good stuff."
"December 11, 2012","Excellent for when you are commuting on the bus or train. You can hear all of your selections from the cloud."
"July 26, 2014","Very frustrating"
"August 28, 2014","not for me"
"January 23, 2013","New to this MP3 but so far it is great! Ipad, smart phone and pc I have used with this and no problems!"
"March 28, 2013","I do not know how to use it. Since I got it I was never able to review. I don't know what it is"
"July 31, 2014","Amazon is great"

"July 28, 2014","it is wonderful"
"December 4, 2011","I like it. Amazon always has the music I want to buy, Google Play is lacking in that department. This player is fine, works when I need it, simple to use."

"January 12, 2013","this is probably my favorite app. i can listen to it in my car and while i work out, anywhere LOVE it"
"January 26, 2013","Never downloaded this app until now. Have not use it yet, but it seems to be a good app for music"
"January 26, 2013","Buy any music you can imagine with this app. There is always a $5 album and a free song available."

"April 4, 2011","Works perfectly and is very easy to use on the g-tablet. i am sure there are some limitations, but i haven't come accross them in my usage."
"April 19, 2011","I actually prefer to use this app most times instead of using the stock android music player. I've put a good amount of music on the cloud to listen to when ever I want to and I have some music on my actual device as well.  I do think the background should be black since that seems to take less battery, plus the contrast of white on black is easier to see than vice versa.  I think the Cloud import function should give the option to convert files that aren't mp3 to mp3. Its not necessary but if it did do that I wouldn't need to open iTunes for much of anything.  Great updates."
"July 20, 2014","Awesome"
"January 19, 2013","This is a good app to use use to get songs for your phone and Amazon is fair in their pricing."
"July 2, 2014","poor sound"

"March 19, 2012","I love listening to my music in the cloud. streaming music is great and fast. still uploading music from my Mac."
"August 23, 2012","It was good until Amazon decided to give you a low limit on free cloud space. Now I use Google play for my phone."
"May 23, 2012","works as advertised. song sounded good. cloud storage easy and accessable. use it, it works great. simple and easy at Amazon"
"July 15, 2014","Awesome"
"July 13, 2014","Awesome"

"July 18, 2014","Super"
"October 3, 2012","I liked how fast I was able to find music I wanted and download it and have it available to me. Great app"
"February 14, 2014","DID I MENTION IT MOVED ALL MY ITUNES MUSIC OVER? AMAZON MP3 IS AWESOME! IT HAS A LARGE CAPACITY IN THE CLOUD SO I DON'T HAVE TO CLOG MY DEVICE UP WITH ALL OF MY SONGS AT ONCE OR PAY FOR MORE SPACE LIKE SOME OTHER SERVICES REQUIRE. I USE IT NOW AS MY PRIMARY MUSIC SOURCE!"
"July 14, 2014","Great"
"July 14, 2014","great"
"October 5, 2012","Needed it for a hypnosis track I needed to download to my laptop as well as my tablet and it works great."
"January 4, 2012","This AP desperately needs a widget option since playing music from your cloud drive does integrate with any of the native music players."
"April 29, 2013","This app is the app for you and it is fun I love it get it is so cool get it"
"June 12, 2014","I just wish it could pull music from my Google collection. The new update is excellent, I must say! The only downside to it, which is minor, is that it is locked in portrait mode. Getting that fixed and the ability to include and stream valid mp3s from, or merge with, Google music library."
"July 12, 2012","This app will not work on my galaxy note with ICS.I have uninstalled and re installed several times with no luck."
"April 28, 2017","I like that there is music available on Amazon, but the selection isn't super without paying extra and the app freezes my phone all of the time. If I were paying for music I would go with another service, but it is music and I do occasionally use it."
"March 8, 2012","works great on my HTC EVO. never had issues with playback and the sound quality is great. it is dangerously convenient though."
"April 1, 2011","I know you can download music for free, but that doesn't support the artists who make it. This is far above the apple music store."
"August 14, 2014","it was good"
"June 23, 2014","FIRST OFF SPOTIFY (FREE NOT PREMIUM) IS BY FAR THE BEST MUSIC APP. I KNEW THAT SINCE AMAZON PRIME MUSIC JUST LAUNCHED I WOULD HAVE TO LOWER MY EXPECTATIONS BUT THE SERVICE IS EVEN WORSE THAN I EXPECTED.  THE USER INTERFACE IS CLUNKY NOT STREAMLINED LIKE SPOTIFY ETC. WHEN I CLICK ON A PLAYLIST IN MY LIBRARY I CAN NEVER GET THE PLAYLIST TO PLAY ON MY CELL PHONE...KEEP GETTING MESSAGE ""ERROR...PLEASE TRY BACK LATER OR CONTACT AMAZON.""  I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IMPRESSED WITH AMAZON AND THEIR PRODUCTS (PRIME TV, FIRE TABLETS ETC.) SO I AM FOREVER HOPEFUL THAT THEY CAN TURN AROUND WHAT HAS BEEN A DISASTER UNTIL NOW TO EVENTUALLY COMPETE WITH, IF NOT SURPASS, SPOTIFY'S AWESOME SERVICE."
"September 10, 2012","I use this App on my iPad. It's easy, fast and the audio and video are fabulous!!! I highly recommend!"
"November 22, 2012","I cant get it to work on my new phone. I switched to htc evo and can not purchase downloads."
"May 9, 2017","like I said, works great on my s5 phone. but you would think that it being Amazon music it would work on your Kindle. Nope, don't even have it available for download on the Kindle. Go figure. but its nice to have the app on my phone for travel."
"March 29, 2011","Cloud is where its at, not sure about battery drain yet, but seems ok so far. You can also get 20gb for free if you buy an album by the end of the year."
"February 4, 2016","While playing music from Amazon Prime channels, this app frequently stops playing songs about a half a minute before said songs are supposed to finish. I then get 30 seconds of silence before the next song plays.  I have other online streaming music apps on my Android phone (SiriusXM, Pandora, TuneIn), and NONE of them exhibit this annoying behavior ... so it's not my phone, and it's not my network connection; it's this buggy app.  Dear Amazon: you're supposed to be providing me with entertainment, not agita."
"September 7, 2012","Love this app. I am able to access all of my music in my Cloud Player with just a touch of a button."
"August 21, 2012","Almost perfect. My problem with this ap is I have over 2000 songs but it only shows me 2k. Why Amazon?"
"August 19, 2012","I get all my mp3 here. good bye itunes. Hello Amazon 9 out of 10 Down loading is easy and fun for all."
"October 14, 2014","The Amazon Prime Music app crashes every time I try to use it on my OnePlus One phone. It used to be it would crash when I tried to play the ""free"" songs I downloaded to my device, but now it won't play ANY songs.  Spotify and other music players work fine still on this device..."
"December 12, 2011","Screen says need to switch language to English (United states), French (Frence), or Dutch... Then does not open again, Please Fix!"
"August 21, 2012","You got another thing coming if you think 250 songs is worth anything. At least put the limit at 5GB."
"May 1, 2011","it's all about the cloud, it's the best thing, well not to mention actually buying CDs from Amazon is cheap and non drm locked"
"November 24, 2012","It is a app to download music and it works It is a app to download music and it works"
"July 22, 2011","I hardly ever use it. Most of my music won't show up on it. Its problaby because of how it was ripped. Needs more codec support I guess (???)."
"March 30, 2013","Haven't used it enough to give a full review. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11"
"January 4, 2014","This is a great app for my phone,mp3 player and tablet. If I don't want to sync to my music on my toys I can still hear them all thru cloud. I like buying singles alot better than the whole album cause sometimes I only want one song.. Downloading is fast. Another great amazon product. I love amazon! I never shop anywhere else cause it has everything and at wonderful prices. Just recently joined Amazon Prime and since I do alot of shopping with Amazon the money I have saved as already paid for my yearly membership. Come on people 2 day shipping at no cost! What could be better. Should also say that if you lose your music you can always go to your amazon music and download it for free!"
"December 31, 2011","This is UK only. Prices show in pounds an no cloud drive access. Worthless and cant uninstall. 18 19 2o words to post????!!!"
"January 29, 2012","Love the amazon mp3 idea. I put 12k of my mp3s into the cloud. This software needs more work ..getting there though ..."
"May 4, 2012","It's very unstable on my motorola photon.. Requires me to restart the whole phone to get the app running again"
"October 4, 2011","Shame on amazon. This app no longer shows the daily free mp3 on the main screen, nor can you search for it through the app!!!! :-("
"July 15, 2016","I love how it works and the ease of use, however it doesn't have the variety I would like to see. I am pleased with the service overall and my husband recently became a prime member just for prime music. I love that I can use it on any computer/tablet that I can log into my Amazon account on without having to download anything. There is a smartphone/tablet app that I use because it takes me to straight to prime music without going in though my account. I have had other music programs in the past that I couldn't use at work because they required me to download a program to use on my work computer. That is not the case here and I really like that."
"July 3, 2012","The only thing I think it needs is a complete my album option to get five stars. Otherwise, great app."
"July 5, 2014","Love Amazon. Absolutely love the new Prime Music. But why oh why can I not access music in my digital music library from my HTC phone like I used to before this new app took over? I shelled out $30 for the larger storage space and was enjoying it constantly until one day a bunch of my music was gone. Even worse, songs I've since imported into my cloud library and songs I've purchased from Amazon on my pc are not accessible on my HTC via the new app. Until this is fixed, Amazon has lost my digital download business. So sad."
"September 9, 2012","I bought this in 2011 for my 13 year old son and he just loves it!!! We have had no problems."
"February 14, 2012","Great idea. The set up and use of amazon's ""cloud"" was really easy. A little reading/research, a few clicks, and good to go. The MP3 ""downloader"" was even easier...  Now I have access to my music collection from any internet link. I don't have to worry about transporting my CD's, or getting them scratched, stolen, or otherwise damaged/lost.  I can download or stream over my laptop, smartphone, and still transfer to my MP3. My music collection is very easy to deal with now, and I have more options than ever. No more lost, stolen, or scratched CD's!! (YAY!!!) =)"
"April 1, 2011","thinking of switching from iTunes now. just needs a little eye candy and ui clean up :-) cloud option is very good. thanks for the free storage."
"January 30, 2012","Very easy to use, no worrys, sound is great, lay out is good. Easy to find songs and albums. Like the player and eq."
"April 9, 2011","Maybe it's just me, but I refuse to update if the developer will not take the time to write up a change log. what was fixed? what was added?"
"September 3, 2011","I really loved this app, but now it locks up my atrix, will use google music until they figure it out.... Please get it fixed"
"December 10, 2011","This is the best way to get all of your music on your smart phone without having to have a lot of memory. Great app."
"December 4, 2011","I have downloaded the MP3 player several times and only get the UK version. No cloud access. Anyone that can help?"
"October 23, 2014","Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums from the Prime library. I'm not sure if there is a way to download them onto my phone and play them through the app that way, but it's not a big deal.  Reason I gave it four stars is due to layout and navigation. I should be able to click on the artist's name from any song and see all albums/songs by that artist. Also, sometimes the buttons get stuck below the display area of my phone (3.5"" phone). I also see that it runs a bit sluggish (1 ghz phone).  Again, pretty good app and I'm happy with it. Hopefully we'll see some improvements and make this a truly outstanding app/service."
"November 17, 2011","I've used it a few times, and it worked good. Try it you'll like it. Saves a lot of room on you're tablet."
"October 31, 2011","I got away from this Amazon app and moved on to a generic app. Music Search and Download is what I use now."
"October 25, 2016","It wont load into my Droid Turbo 2. There is an error message even after I change the security functions on my phone they request that I'm not happy in doing. This is the WORST. I sent a report but no response.  Not only can I not use it. I also don't have access to my paid library of music because I the old app that DID work is no longer available from what I've found. Thus Amazon owe me a couple hundred dollars in music. They should have left the old MP3 app available til they worked the bugs out. But like most large entities this days it's about the bottom line not the consumers needs."
"October 9, 2011","Why did the daily free song disappear??? It use to be there. There is no reason to use this app then. 1 star."
"June 29, 2014","No trace of this app on my kindle, tech support says to be patient - why should I be patient? If something isn't ready, don't put it on your website or store shelves. Bought a kindle fire just to use this app but it doesn't exist."
"October 11, 2011","What happend to the free song of the day ): Bring back and i'll add two stars. Everything else works well."
"April 16, 2014","Now I can have my music whereever I go without having to take along a separate mp player. my grandkids like it because it has their favorite music on there as well. You can play from the cloud or download to your mobile device."
"March 3, 2015","Oh, man...I was really hoping this would allow me to get rid of Spotify Premium and save some $$ each month. False. This app has one of the least user-friendly interfaces I've ever experienced. It's almost like they don't want you to use it...I'm really hoping they get this fixed, because it was a large part of why I renewed my Prime membership for another year."
"December 25, 2016","Keeps on giving me an authentication error exception #117"
"April 26, 2011","The last update makes this app an all in one player. Please add additional widgets, 4x2 would be perfect. Keep it up."
"May 15, 2015","The importing process from iTunes was no easy task and as I use it with my Samsung network speakers (purchased through Amazon) it is not smooth. I know it is Amazon music because the stream from network works fine while the stream from Amazon jumps and cuts off songs. For the price and nearly unlimited number of songs it gets 3 stars."
"September 28, 2016","This crap will not install! Tried numerous times, read tons of reviews of others with the same problem. Amazon tech can't get it to work either. This app is junk and amazon prime delivery is terrible also, they're consistently late but they're late taking my hundred bucks. They blame it on the UPS, USPS AND OTHER CARRIERS. ALL THIS IS AMAZONS MISMANAGEMENT!!! Love to see Amazon bankrupt"
"October 27, 2014","This is app is a must if you have invested in Amazon Prime and want to make the most of the music resources available. Works equally well on my Kindle, Nexus 7 tablet and Android phone (Galaxy S 5). Having access to a relatively rich and varied library gives the user more personal control than streaming services. The pre-selected playlists are entertaining and the ability to create your own playlists is good. I primarily take advantage of the music that is freely accessible through my Prime account. I have not purchased any songs or albums. The app, itself, is clean, straightforward and easy to use."
"February 21, 2012","I rally want to love this app, and I did for the first couple of days - it has two odd the features I want in a music player: good lock screen and it remembers the last song that played even if it was closed for days. and then I tried the shuffle button on the songs list, it showed me 0 out of 0 songs and when I tried to get out of there it crashed. since I dint want to create a play list for shuffling over all my songs, this is more or less a deal breaker. I would also love to have the option of uploading songs to the cloud This review is for the galaxy s2 on Sprint"
"October 18, 2011","Crashed at start up and now wouldnt open fix the bug. Got a froze and than black screen. Oh no"
"October 11, 2017","really impressed for an early stage, post adopter app quality/function and enormous library all amazing, look forward to seeing what is next and how it competes against the newly merged rivals"
"June 18, 2011","Plenty of storage available for free. I use it mostly for sharing access to my mp3s between multiple devices. Not sure how well the streaming works or how much bandwidth it consumes, but the are nice options to allow you to limit downloads while using cellular networks, which may keep you from getting an unpleasant data charge from your provider."
"June 7, 2016","Came to Amazon to download a single mp3 legally. Didn't get the song version right, cause the sample was too short to tell. Also I had to download an app to be able to listen and download song. Ridiculous! Already uninstalled!"
"February 25, 2015","Where's the metal? It's all mainstream. I am constantly let down by Pandora and other so called music apps. I am a metal head who can truly recognize talent in any music I hear. This app is nothing but an extension of the over pampered, over rated, computer synthesized, failure of music today. This is why I enjoy metal. It's one of the few mediums left today that still has true heart. Sadly, even many of the hearts of this genera is selling out faster than American Idol can ruin the youth who watch and silently dream of this pop music crap."
"December 16, 2013","I love that the music purchased from this app lets me choose what device I want to play it on. Other e-music publishers, will only let you play their music on their devices. However, I can purchase a song on my android, play it on my windows PC, and load it onto my iPod to listen to whenever I want. Also, I am always able to stream the music (when data connected) from the Amazon Cloud.  Keep it up Amazon, this is what purchasing all online media should be like!"
"October 15, 2014","It's almost fabulous. I don't have an iPhone so I can't get my iTunes unless I'm at home. This app allow me to listen to my Amazon library while I'm out and about. My one star less is because there's no way (that I've found) to set music to a timer. I like to fall asleep to subliminal and binaural beat tracks sometimes, but I'll wake up hours later and have to turn it off because it just keeps playing. Otherwise, I'm enjoying my tunes :-)"
"February 14, 2013","I'm an old-timer - 47 years old. I grew up buying records and still like to hold something physical in my hands, so, I'm still buying CD's. They all get ripped and it's still incredible to me that these days we can walk around with thousands of songs in our pockets. When Amazon let me know that they now have all my CD purchases already ripped for me, well, that really is icing on the cake! Sound quality is fantastic and I'm enjoying this new feature immensely! Thanks, Amazon!"
"September 29, 2017","Nice to be able to stream 250 of my mp3s. I would probably go for the expanded service if I had a ton more music I wanted to access remotely always, or if it was a bit cheaper."
"May 16, 2016","Haven't used this app as much on my tablet as I do on my work computer, but so far I love it. I love that when I click the thumbs down button, it automatically goes to the next song. Though it has played the song again when I'm on a different ""station"" on occasion. Is really like it if amazon could fix that. The only other issue I have so far, is trying to close the app entirely from full screen mode. Other than that, I'm really liking this whole service and app!"
"July 30, 2016","Excellent music app for prime members. Loads of free playlists and stations that you can stream on your phone or tablet. The app lets you add songs to playlists and your library."
"June 8, 2016","I absolutely LOVE this feature! This app is AMAZING! I really don't know how i listened to music before this! If you have Prime, or your thinking about getting Prime, get this app. You wont regret it!"
"February 18, 2014","To be honest i downloaded this app in hopes of getting free mp3`s after it was suggested from Shazam another music locater app. But sincei noticed that i would have to pay for sounds that i know i can get free even if there is a virus risk, i closed it and never bothered to open it or uninstall it. In search of a mobile app that i wouldnt have to pay for music, if there is anyone with info to provide me with please feel free.  Unfair- it may be unfair that i rated it with only two stars but as i was disappointed the ratings showed."
"August 24, 2011","App installation and buying experience is ok.  What is infuriating is that the app closes randomly. You put the android in your pocket, it closes. Put your phone on your desk, closes. Music stops, and you have to restart the app completely. App takes 15 seconds to load, even on my Samsung Galaxy S 9000. Song has to be restarted from beginning (interruption point was not saved)  All this on our 2 phones (different models) so hardware problems are to be excluded.  Really disappointed."
"June 23, 2014","All of a sudden I have used almost 4GB of data. I made sure the app was set to download via Wi-Fi only and the next day another 2.5GB was downloaded. And the battery drain on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was amazingly slow...until I installed Amazon music and then half of it was gone in half a day with very little use. It appears it automatically syncs with the cloud every 10 minutes without any option for adjustment. Why would I need to sync every 10 minutes? Very disappointing. Uninstalled it from ALL our phones. Please fix these issues!"
"October 21, 2015","offline has many Glitches. offline should not require Loading that's the whole point of Offline so I find it reacting like its buffering. needs offline quality setting added"
"June 15, 2014","Since the update of Amazon mp3 player, many of the songs I purchased thru Amazon, and downloaded thru Amazon, will not play. I get ""exception 119"" or other playback errors. This is annoying in and of itself, but when using the player during a run or workout, it completely stops the player, meaning I have to finish the run/workout without music, or break my pace/concentration to skip to the next song.  Getting a paltry number of ""free"" (for prime) songs to choose from doesn't override the inconvenience of a player that doesn't play....."
"October 21, 2014","I think it's great although I would like to be able to download music to my PC or iMac rather than just my mobile telephone. Since it's bundled with Prime Instant Video, I'm not getting my money's worth and should only have to pay a portion of the $99.00 that I'm being charged. When I want to buy something, I'm told that I have to use a local credit card which charges me an exchange fee (I live abroad). However, when I signed up, Amazon gladly accepted my U.S. credit card. Don't you think that's a bit hypocritical?"
"June 18, 2016","I can't get enough of Amazon prime music. The numerous different stations are fantastic and the variety is great. It is my go-to app. The ability to download so many artistes is a plus . I love having the music playing in the background when I go to sleep. I just need amazon to make an app compatible for Windows phone."
"October 31, 2014","Great extra with the prime membership. I would give it five stars but it lacks the content that a beats music or spotify have. I would gladly pay a little extra on my prime membership to have access to the amount of content I now get with beats music. It would make my life easier not to have an additional music service that I have to pay for monthly. I already pay for netflix, hulu plus, beats music and wwe network monthly, to get rid of beats and replace it with a vamped up prime music service would be ideal."
"January 10, 2015","It froze up frequently requiring me to pull the battery to reboot my phone, a brand new Samsung S5. I never could get it to recognize my amazon account, so I couldn't stream prime music or even retrieve albums I've purchased. It was a huge resource and battery hog too. After trying a second install and an update I gave up and deleted it. Canceled my prime membership too."
"October 21, 2017","I like the cost versus some other guys. There are some tracks that I cannot find though. But the price makes it all better."
"June 23, 2017","Works great and I love that the songs I purchased are on there. Plus all the other channels that are available. I just wish phone company's didn't hammer us with usage charges"
"June 16, 2014","I suppose it may be OK, but since I am an ""Invited Guest"" of a Prime member (my wife), I can't use it on my smartphone or Kindle Fire (my wife has neither so there's zero chance of having more than one device using it at a time). I checked with Amazon and that's just the way it is. Tough luck, I guess. I'll continue using my subscriptions to Spotify and Panora."
"February 19, 2013","I have turned my back on iTunes. This is my music library now. I have this app on my phone and I can download whatever songs I want from my Amazon library. I can download music I've purchased from Amazon or songs I've uploaded (like the songs I imported from my old iTunes. Once the song is on my phone, I can listen even if I'm not in a WiFi area, and it doesn't need my data minutes either. You can sort by artist or album or song or genre, and you can make playlists too."
"February 1, 2017","After opening app, the first time after a while ""+ Add album to my music"" button is pressed I am redirected to an amazon prime screen, and the album I selected is lost. It takes multiple attempts to purchase mp3s. Headache after headache using the store."
"October 28, 2016","Never installed....and the new version of amazon and Amazon video sucks. I am bot planning on renewing my yearly subscription. I believe that Amazon is doing this intentionally to discourage people and fix their money issue they saythat Amazon prime has caused them. Shame on you if this is true, you took our money well enough and now that it has caused you some issue in the delivery side, you start to have download and launch issues."
"June 13, 2017","Love this player when I am not on a computer. I can listen to music anytime I want with headphone or ear plugs!"
"January 27, 2016","It is the worst music app yet.the update pop up won't quit.i just deleted the app..it only about money to this website. an you guys need to catch up with eBay on the fees ypu chatge an keep the customers money for 21 dayz like them.imagine the money from interest ypu collect on other people's money."
"August 1, 2012","I have been using this app for a year on my android phone (Verizon droid razr). I uploaded all of the music I own (aprox 15gb) to my cloud drive and use the amazon mp3 app in place of the music app provided by android. I love that it lets me play music on my phone or in my cloud from anywhere or purchase music and play it without having to download. A few glitches here and there but the features and ease of use far outweigh any drawbacks for me."
"October 1, 2016","ok"
"August 28, 2017","Wife bought me a CD for my birthday and its not shared through her prime account...do we really both have to buy it that's retarded..."
"January 13, 2015","I listen to what I want,don't have to mess around with thumbs down and I love everything that goes with the package,I'm Primed!"
"March 19, 2015","I have listened to a lot of the Prime Music that I had lost track of through the years. It is hard to keep up with the format changes, records, tapes, 8-tracks,and CD's. For instance....I hadn't listened to Joni Mitchell in years and found her music as delightful as I did in the 60's. I have a bluetooth speaker to use with my Android, and a computer connected to my A-V system and it has been wonderful to have access to so much music in an instant."
"August 2, 2014","The app is more frustration than enjoyment on my Android phone. I have given up on it working and have uninstalled it."
"March 30, 2017","I love my Amazon Music. It is great that Amazon offers so many different things with Prime."
"June 23, 2014","I got all excited for nothing when they announced prime music streaming... the songs won't download to my device! And there is no way to determine where to download it to (device vs sd card). How annoying! Not sure why Amazon would announce something that doesn't work and doesn't seem to have a help section to tell you how to make it work?! You're better than this Amazon, I paid almost $100 for my Prime membership so I believe in you Amazon!!!"
"June 16, 2014","I'm excited to see where Amazon will go with this new feature. It's early so naturally there will be some quirks. Initially I found it a bit difficult to navigate and find music in my library. I'm curious if I cancel my subscription to Prime if I no longer have access to the music I loaded onto my device. For now I'll go with 3 stars but hope as the program develops it will improve. It's Amazon, I'm sure it will be a great product in no time."
"February 23, 2013","Amazon MP3 was preinstalled on my Android device, and I initially uninstalled it because I don't like ""Bloatware"". However, I got an email from Amazon that said my former CD purchases were available through the Cloud Player and that made me change my decision to reinstall the app. I enjoy the fact that most CD's are automatically 'ripped' to the Cloud once purchased, making my music available anywhere. Great product for FREE."
"September 21, 2014","Nice to have some free download options as a benefit for having prime; however, it would also be nice to be able to listen to those free songs through another music app i.e. poweramp. I understand why, but what good is having cake if you can't eat it, too? That being said, I think all other aspects of this app, based on my brief experience thus far, are wonderful and the average user/listener would really enjoy what it has to offer."
"June 21, 2017","Lowest ratings possible; because it does not work in my country of Trinidad and Tobago"
"October 28, 2014","Nice idea but still room for improvement. Android app user interface isn't as intuitive as it should be, and capabilities in general seem limited. For instance, the ability to shuffle across a collection of albums or a user-defined playlist doesn't exist or has eluded my search so far.  That said, the audio quality seems fine and it's a nice added benefit that halps make up for increasing the cost of a Prime membership."
"July 18, 2015","Use it for dinner parties, for everything! I listened to an album that I wanted to buy and realized it sucked, so it saved me extra money!"
"April 26, 2011","I have downloaded the app and on my Samsung Galaxy S I find I am connected to Amazon MP3 UK. UK? I live in the US. I can't find any online help with this and the best I got from Amazon is that they don't know what is going on and I should call them to resolve the issue. I don't want to call them, I want an app that works correctly.  Great idea but the app isn't ready for prime time."
"January 19, 2016","I was so excited about this app until I actually tried to use it much. First off, the music I download disappears all the time and I have to redownload, which is a pain in the butt.  Secondly, the music stutters when I try to play it via the headphone jack, which means it's practically useless to me since I primarily use it to listen to music in the car.  Back to Google play music I go. =/"
"February 21, 2013","While it's pretty spare in the features area, it is a quick and easy way to access my music collection in the Amazon cloud. I can easily download the content to my player (a Samsung Galaxy S phone that has been re-purposed into a media server) or stream it without difficulty. I would especially like more sorting and indexing options (it's very literal on the artist name - I would like to be able to do wildcard searches)."
"February 7, 2013","I installed this on my and my wife's new Samsung Galaxy S III (Android) phones and we love it. All of the CD's that we've ever bought on Amazon were instantly available on our phones, either for streaming (which worked great and saves space on your phone) or downloading for listening when you don't have cell service. You can also load other music to the cloud and listen to it on your phone. It's great!"
"September 17, 2017","I love the instant rip and available music with my prime subscription."
"October 21, 2014","Wish all music was downloadable trough prime subscription not just some but I like the selection available"
"June 30, 2011","I installed this App last night thinking oh neat free MP3 of the day, since its instillation my tablet has been unuseable. I will be needing to send it to the factory to get it running again as the amazon apps crash taking the entire device with it. I will not only not be reinstalling it when my Tablet is repaired I will not be installing any amazon software again."
"June 24, 2017","New, haven't figured out how to use yet. 7/31/17 still have not used this. please cancel anything that I have to pay for. it is too technical for me to enjoy. I signed up for a free month, but I have not used it and I want it cancelled. please do not charge me for any music, or videos. please cancel this. thanks, Rosemary"
"August 3, 2012","Not sure why people give this one star just because they can't uninstall it. That's not the apps fault that you bought a phone with pre loaded apps. I use this on a galaxy nexus and it works great. It remains to be seen how the ""improvements"" to the cloud player will affect those who do not pay but I have been pleased with Amazon cloud player since I started using it."
"October 14, 2014","Great music app with a ton of free music if you have Amazon Prime. I love it!"
"September 25, 2017","Worthless if you can't get the prime member music"
"June 22, 2017","Its waaaay louder than spotify was. I had to max my car out and have treble all the way up to hear songs. Now my radio is on 40 and treble is down and is way better."
"February 9, 2017","I get all the music I want, right to my phone. I love this."
"October 22, 2014","Amazing selection. Thanks Amazon Prime for ALL the goodies you offer members."
"March 23, 2017","So what exactly does having a prime membership get you in this app? Amazon keeps telling me I can listen to ""free music"" with a prime membership but it seems one needs another membership on top of that to actually play anything. Really disappointed at what this app turned out to be"
"March 18, 2015","One of the unexpected benefits of Amazon prime is the music service that comes with it. Download the Amazon music app and your all set to enjoy thousands of music files. You can stream them our download them to your phone. They are available as full albums, individual songs, or listen to preselected playlists. Get Amazon prime so you can appreciate everything you get with it."
"January 14, 2015","Easy to use, great selection of free music if you are a prime member."
"January 20, 2013","This is good app to store most, not all my music (only because I haven't paid the $25 annual fee). Great playback. It would have gotten 5 stars but it has an tendency to give playback errors or sometimes have connection issues on all sources (PC, tablet or cell). If that gets fixed would give 5 stars for sure!"
"March 20, 2015","I haven't had any issues. I don't care if I don't have enough memory on my 16gb galaxy s4, my 64gb sd card is useless because I can't store anything from here on it. So yes it uses up all my memory. I don't care. I get to listen to my music, and buy new songs as they come out. I'm always listening to music. I just wish the app didn't take up so much of my memory."
"February 10, 2013","I listen to all my friends with Iphones complain about the trouble of moving music and such. I can't sympathize with them. The ease of Amazon MP3 is great. I even uploaded my music to my cloud. I can listen to it anywhere. IT IS AWESOME....DownLOAD it now...why are you still reading this..go download."
"October 9, 2014","Just want to say Thank You Amazon. Since I love music so much, you made it so easy to listen to them. I love the many choices I have to listen to, not limited to just certain ones. So easy to find and navigate and explore. I even told my family and friends to join up. They sure wont be disappointed at all. Keep up the Good Work. Love Ya Guys."
"May 5, 2017","There's some decent music on it but the variety is limited."
"June 4, 2017","I'm a music love and as such, will try out everything available. Amazon is the most recent musical trip I've taken and it might be that I've reached my home for music. I've been a Prime member for many years and it's paid for itself over and over. This is just another reason my membership has worked for me."
"October 18, 2016","Amazon lacks the ability to share files or it hides instructions or directions on how to do it. I just purchased a number of Adele tunes but can't transfer them to my Google play library. Why?"
"February 12, 2013","This app only allows you to download your music to internal storage which is limited and valuable. No ability to save to external SD card by 2013 is a massive failure by a massive company."
"October 8, 2017","Good app easy to use.good music."
"October 13, 2017","Easy to get. easy to use. Love this!!!!"
"October 13, 2014","App crashes if I try to use it without an internet connection, and gives frequent errors while streaming. Haven't been able to listen to a single full album. Just terrible"
"October 9, 2017","Damn confusing...I gave up :("
"June 21, 2017","Amazing, far better than pandora."
"March 31, 2017","It is very reliable price."
"April 29, 2017","you got music any time any where"
"October 9, 2014","As an Android user and an Amazon Prime member, I got this app to take advantage of the Prime Music Amazon now offers for free for their Prime subscribers. It is functional and the music selection has improved vastly since it started up this summer. If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber and have an Android device you might as well take advantage of this."
"March 25, 2017","Very good deal for $8 per month!"
"October 24, 2016","clunky and not as good as Google Music"
"June 19, 2017","Unlike other music apps we have tried Amazon music does not have ads or commercials and I love that."
"July 9, 2014","Garbage in the first degree...a long time amazon music purchaser...now I'm shut out as on my samsung S3 downloads aren't in my library...uninstalled reinstalled wasted a lot of time...now can't login to it on my phone...I'm very tech savvy so the fault is with the amazon music app...deleted...used to work great...on to spotify or dare I say...iTunes...ugh"
"June 13, 2014","Broke will not work on Samsung Galaxy Note. Tried Google play and Amazon apps, Google says it's already downloaded (it's not) and Amazon says it's incompatible... Seriously, WTF?"
"February 14, 2013","I completely changed from Itunes due to their many restrictions. I am a very firm believer in if you buy music it should be yours, not with a copyright restrictions and also only to be coded to be played by certain devices. So Amazon music is the only place I now purchase from, and it is saved in my account for me to access at all times anywhere."
"November 7, 2011","I can't believe it but I don't see a way to play all music by genre. This option appears in the web based player but its not on the Android software.  How can this be left out??  One star until this is fixed. The Google music beta wins hands-down.  This is a must have feature!  Boo."
"March 31, 2017","great gift"
"March 19, 2015","I've had this app since it came out and I love it. However, last night I downloaded Android 5.1 to my phone, now Amazon music player crashes whenever I hit play on any Prime Music. Please fix!! My morning commute is not the same!!  UPDATE 3/23/15: got the 5.1 fix installed, happy days are here again! Changing to 5 stars, thanks Amazon!"
"October 24, 2014","Hugely unstable on OnePlus One (and apparently other OPO devices) for several subsequent releases. Unusably flaky on an Ouya. Amazon kindly flags the app as uninstallable on the OnePlus in the Google Play store, but still enables access to the app on both devices through their own. Left hand, meet right hand. Or better yet: Just fix it."
"June 17, 2014","Finally! This is great so far, I used the Amazon MP3 for all my music, so the transition wasn't bad for me. My only criticism is that their catalog for streaming is not that big, but I understand that this is because the service is brand new. I am sure as time goes the catalog of songs available is going to increase. Thank you Amazon!"
"April 11, 2017","Great selection"
"October 21, 2014","Works well with a few exceptions. Wish there was a way to delete downloaded items just off my device when I need to free up storage, there's always a little freeze in the playback when I'm streaming over Bluetooth and I lock my phone, and on android can be way too complicated to kill the app. Other than that I'm really satisfied"
"February 13, 2013","There have been too many instances when my normal music device has a drained battery and I've got nothing to listen to on my too-long daily commute, except for the loud talkers. That was the case until I installed Amazon MP3 on my 'droid phone. Now I can drown out those who don't use their inside voices on the commuter train."
"July 1, 2017","Love it"
"April 23, 2014","I like being able to get my Cloud music and play it on my phone. The one problem I have with it is that without me adding them in there it picked up ringtones I had downloaded to my phone and put them in my list of songs. I had to manually go through and delete all of them which was a bit annoying. Other than that it works well."
"June 5, 2013","The fact that Amazon has offered this app for free is great but when installed on a smart phone instead of wanting to play songs downloaded to the hard drive on the phone it always wants to go on the net to play from the cloud. This became so annoying to me that I now use an entirely differant music player on my phone."
"February 25, 2013","It took two neices and three freinds to convience me to get this app to help me work my new tablet and they were right. This is a great app to find other great apps. I am not sure I would ever be able to work the computer but now I have all types of helpful and fun apps on my tablet, thanks to Amazon and my family."
"October 23, 2014","This app used to work fine on my OnePlus One, but now it crashes all the time. Please fix ASAP so that I can enjoy it once again.  I believe there might be a compatibility issue with the latest CM 38R update?"
"March 9, 2013","No problems before I downloaded this app. After downloading Net would disconnect every 2 -3 minutes. UNINSTALLED after 20 minutes. No problems now And then I tried to install the cloud player.... can't find the widget... and it is also unstable on the site. I try to play something and it will just stop playing."
"October 18, 2014","Love love love"
"January 25, 2015","yeah it works"
"May 24, 2011","i had this app downloaded via the amazon app store for a few weeks and i constantly had issues with it. downloaded from the android market, and it works fine.  streaming at times takes just a little bit too long on 3G (as opposed to google music beta. which is nearly instant)"
"May 12, 2011","Can't even install it because my default language isn't english. oh wait my phones default language is english. fail.  i've never had this issue before with any other app. why not just take this setting out and let us select what language we would like to install the app in."
"March 22, 2015","Outstanding hands down"
"February 11, 2013","Perfect. Fast downloads. Much better than itunes. The new auto-rip feature for cds is wonderful. I hope it will include vinyl in the future. (Sooner rather than later) Love it love it love it!!!"
"September 2, 2015","This is really really good. What can I say? All sorts of music, even the obscure stuff that I like. Free to stream within your annual prime subscription. I stream musiic at home, at work and on the train. The movies are rubbish, but the music and free next day delivery are worth the £70 a year."
"February 20, 2013","This is my go-to app for all music now. Once you go Amazon, you can't go back... or something like that. Great product....easy to use... have some issuesa saving mp3s to my SD card on my phone.....so I just save them like normal, then use a file manager app to move them where I actually want them :p"
"March 18, 2015","I so enjoyed rebuilding my library after loosing it to a system crash. What I liked most of all was the access to the many music playlists that are available and also the music that had been on my wish list for years were made available through Prime. Thank you. Yours Truly a future Prime Member."
"February 10, 2013","I love the way I can go either on my phone, or my laptop and search for music etc. I already have an account with Amazon, so everything downloads instantly, and without problems. If I should have a problem, it is usually very easy to fix."
"March 17, 2017","On how spoiled I was when I had my Google play music subscription. Amazon music just cannot compete with the real deal. Google Play also gets Youtube Red that alone is worth the price."
"May 9, 2011","The app functionality is fine. But starts itself even if I'm not using it. I was there for love to uninstall it however there install put it under system so I can't. how do I remove 1 of those? and whose stupid idea was it to install it under system by default..."
"April 27, 2011","UPDATE After review of system event log it appears there is a conflict with an EQ library loaded by the Equalizer app. After stopping this app Amazon MP3 player works fine, no Force Close. After loading Amazon MP3 Player, the Equalizer app says the device does not support Reverb effect, so it looks like two conflicting libraries using the same API and if Amazon's loads first both programs can co-exist but with reduced functionality in Equalizer.  Useless. Any attempt to open the settings menu or play music causes a Force Close. Test this code on Google flagship phones before you release it, ya big dorks.  Nexus S"
"November 10, 2012","I use this app on my Nexus7 and have had no problems. Streams my purchased music and personal uploads to my tablet with no problems."
"June 16, 2014","I will admit this isn't the best music streaming app, but if you are a prime member, I'd say it is a must have. I have had trouble finding a couple of songs/albums in the prime/free streaming section, but for the most part I can find what I am looking for or something that is close enough."
"February 9, 2013","I love being able to carry my music everywhere I go without buy the same songs two or three times. This is an easy way to put songs onto multiple portable devices, and maintain them for long periods of time. You also don't have to buy the same tracks for each device which is convient."
"March 18, 2015","I listen to a LOT of music and have found several thousand songs that I enjoy listening to. And it's really great to have all this available on my desktop, laptop, tablet and phone! SIMPLY WONDERFUL! The recent updates to the music app make it easy to use. GOOD WORK AMAZON!"
"February 18, 2013","What a fun little AP !!I have it on all of my electronics. SO far no glitches. It was difficult for my tablet to get itself onboard but once it was........... super! It was a tablet issue not the AP issue. TRY IT!!!!"
"January 1, 2017","very gooood! thank you Amazon music"
"October 28, 2014","Not bad, but too commercial - oriented toward selling tracks & albums. Just no way I'm gonna pay a buck or so for digital music downloads. Also not user-friendly for me. I give three stars rather than two because it's free (for Prime members). Going back to Rhapsody."
"November 11, 2011","This is honestly the best app ever. I uploaded all of my CDs to the cloud, and I use it to listen to my music on my computer in my office. I can also plug my phone into my cars stereo and it works great even over 3g."
"February 14, 2013","Works exceptionally well. i purchased a CD and the Cloud/Bitrate option to download Apocalyptica's ""Worlds Collide"" album. Unlike most of you who might read this, I am not generally a consumer of music downloads. As a first experience with this, it was great!"
"October 19, 2014","A bit dissapointed with Amazon music, especially with the fact that not all music is available to prime members, even if it was all included, it still wouldnt be that good, They are missing a lot of amazing artists, Bands and Producers. Its a good start though I guess."
"February 25, 2016","Dope"
"March 31, 2017","This sucks!!! Getting no where trying to get this on my I phone !!!!"
"March 27, 2012","I think this app would be great if I could sign in but I can't. Tried reinstalling, no luck. Tired different keyboards no luck. Can type in user name and password but nothing happens when I press enter and there is no sign in button. Please fix this"
"February 25, 2013","I buy a lot of my music from Amazon, so this app is perfect for downloading and syncing that music without any fuss. I don't use it as a player, because I don't play it off the ""cloud"" and I have a much better program for playing the music on my device."
"October 13, 2014","Until i can find a way to hear more than 30 second snip's of songs on my phone this app gets 2 stars...from the PC it works great and is a great added bonus to prime. I dropped my Pandora and will drop Goggle music once I figure out how to hear more of a song."
"January 16, 2017","I don't know why I have to install your music app to purchase music. Very frustrating."
"July 1, 2017","This used to be a great app before they got money hungry. As it Prime member you used to be able to download a lot of music onto my phone and play it later to save data. But now they've updated it and I have to pay to be able to do that. They are taking way too many perks away from Prime members. Even their movie app is not as good as it was, So now I just use Pandora. If this keeps up I will drop my prime membership!"
"April 13, 2013","It's a nice app, but there's not a ton to do with it, which is fine because you're just listening to music. One handy feature is the ability to listen to music stored on the device itself without having to use a separate app. All in all, nothing bad to say."
"March 2, 2013","It was great on my droid, but won't stream on my LG. That's a big deal to me as I was using it all the time. Now if I want a song, I have to download it to my device in order to listen to it. Guess I need a new place to buy all my songs and that sucks."
"March 30, 2011","Version 2.81 works fine, but the new version 3.06 only loads 1/2 of my music and then stops - all albums from N-Z do not load. If you have a large collection (more than about 8,000 songs) - do not upgrade to this version!"
"December 7, 2012","again we got this for my son to be able to get music on his android phone. we have yet to be able to get it to work. even though I have added his device to my account, downloaded the app on the device. it still says he is not authorized to use it."
"December 31, 2016","a great app!"
"March 31, 2011","On DroidX running 2.2, most of my music tracks dont player, the player just sits there thinking about playing the tracks...FOREVER. this app needs to undergo some serious testing and improvement. Those are my thoughts."
"March 31, 2011","Hello. The app is refusing to start because my keyboard has language ""English(Italy)"" since the phone was bought in Italy (I'm actually in the US). Could you just check that the language string starts with ""english""?"
"November 3, 2015","THE JURY IS OUT. AMAZON YOU HAVE A LONG LONG WAY TO GO. New review it's worth every penny!!!! All ways putting together new playlist. Best deal out there. GARRY"
"June 17, 2014","I order a different plug that had a different connection. Because I was desperate to connect to a power source I use it. It worked so I settled. My complaint is with Amazon for sending the wrong item. The order numbers were similar but not the same."
"January 21, 2015","I discovered Enya with this. Especially love her Christmas album, beautiful sounds! I have to load the albums or songs from ipad then they will play on the TV after I sync. Was a Godsend at Christmas! Kept the house peaceful with her voice! :)"
"May 15, 2011","US resident with US Amazon.com account currently in America but my language setting is English UK and it will only allow me sign in to amazon.co.uk. just spent 36 hours uploading my music to amazon.com so I am upset."
"September 18, 2014","Unfortunately I have a windows phone so it doesn't work for me, and my husband has a Samsung Galaxy III that was made for the Canadian market so it won't load into his phone either!!! Looks like we won't be keeping the Prime account after all :("
"February 10, 2013","Amazon still hasn't worked out its cloud server interface as well as they should, and they utterly ignore the needs of people like me who want it to handle podcasts (which iTunes does do)"
"July 16, 2015","I was disappointed on the Super Wednesday prime day when they advertised a fish finder for a low price, but when you opened it up it was more than 25 times the advertised price. Really gets your attention. .... but don't deliver."
"November 13, 2015","This app needs a lot of work . It keeps adding a new device every time I reset my Android device. It sucks"
"May 9, 2011","I was using this app a LOT to listen to music but after updating recently, all it says is 'network error' or 'error playing song' on both 3G and WiFi connections. :'( I will change to 5 stars if it gets fixed"
"June 10, 2011","I didn't know I had a premium plan when I signed up for the service to begin with. Must have missed the memo. I don't know how many people have only 250 songs. Thanks Applezon."
"August 16, 2011","This is a pretty good application, I think that it could use a refresh here and there though. -Otherwise, a good app"
"October 8, 2014","I love this app. It is so easy to listen to either my cloud or what is on my computer with a simple click of the mouse. If you choose, you can also use music prime with this app. It works on my Android phone as well as on my computer."
"April 13, 2013","I really don't use this app. I tend to get my music downloaded for way less through my computer and transfer it to my tablet. I think if I used my tablet for music more often I might enjoy this app more, simply for it's convenience."
"May 18, 2011","My greatest beef with Amazon player is how limited the settings are on the player itself. I love crossfading between tracks. Get this feature and I'll make this my default player. Until then, not so much."
"October 12, 2014","I love to use this app. The downside for me is going to be whether or not I resubscribe to Prime when it comes due. I am not sure I can justify $99 for this privilege. It will be cheaper in the long run to simply buy the music."
"October 20, 2014","So easy to use! Love it!"
"May 2, 2015","Because this seems to be a prerequisite to downloading music purchased from Amazon, I won't be purchasing music from A again. It's difficult to use. It's invasive. It requires the system's security settings to be lowered."
"October 23, 2014","Really great collection of music and it's organization only thing that I'd change is adding a feature close to Pandoras music mix to give you a saved playlist of music close and varying from the original added song or artist."
"June 16, 2014","Love the included music. Prime has even more value now.  The App locks up on my mobile phone and the browser version has a few querks."
"June 26, 2017","Good app"
"October 27, 2014","Even with ""Prime"" you still have to pay for songs or albums! You only get snippets of the music for free, then are required to purchase the individual song or album to hear it in it's entirety. NOT USEFUL AMAZON!"
"July 17, 2011","I can't seem to get this thing to work consistently. It is always telling me to reinstall. Done it several times with no luck. On HTC EVO 4G. Any ideas on getting it to stop saying it has an error?"
"June 29, 2015","I got to say I appreciate Amazon for taking care of my music when I changed phones as delete all the stuff off of one phone two go together they kept my stuff at least one song see the tower you have a blessed day"
"July 7, 2014","735 songs saved to the library in about an hour .....time to party"
"March 30, 2011","Would be great if I didn't constantly get a network error every tone I tried to play a song. The upload of all my music was smooth. Just can't listen to any of my music. Help me out Amazon."
"July 19, 2011","I like the app, plays the free tunes no problem. I purchased 1 song and it keeps coming up with a playback error message. I dont know how to get it to play the song I paid for. Very frustrated!!!"
"December 28, 2014","Can use a revamp on the usability of adding and playing music.Not easy to determine what free music is available via prime."
"May 28, 2014","Says there is a login error and to try signing in again. None of the ""fixes"" I found online worked. It won't let me use any apps I purchased from Amazon until I login. I'm never buying another app from Amazon."
"June 18, 2014","Good operation so far. The search engine defaults to search every song in Amazon library which is a small inconvenience when searching for Prime music only. Also haven't figured out yet how to create my own playlists."
"June 20, 2011","And I bought most music through amazon, anyway, since I dislike iTunes. The streaming isn't great when moving between towers, so I downloaded the music. Yay."
"October 27, 2016","I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and this app loaded but would not install. I tried all the fixes and troubleshooting tips without result. I have other Amazon apps installed and working."
"January 21, 2015","Works pretty good. I was a little annoyed that I had to download it from the Amazon app store instead of the Google play store on my one plus one phone. I also would like a little better method of browsing music"
"June 7, 2011","cant play music stored on cloud drive without crashing. so what's the point of storing your music in the cloud if you cant play it? 1 star until it's fixed"
"January 9, 2016","I love this app, but could be easier to search for specific albums and tracks."
"May 17, 2011","Not the greatest looking mp3 player around, but good enough. Functions well, though network hiccups are common. Fits a need till Google Music goes public."
"October 17, 2014","Oh my gosh! I love this app!!! Now I can have all my favorite songs with me on my computer and phone. Easier to load and access than my i-pod - which is now in the drawer! Best of all my songs were FREE!!!!"
"June 25, 2017","Pretty decent music app"
"June 24, 2017","Love it. Can't find a radio station worth listening to anymore."
"September 24, 2012","I have thoroughly enjoyed this Mp3 App. I listen to Rock & Roll 24/7. If you enjoy music the way I do, especially while working, then this is a must have Mp3 App. Try it out on a Kindle Fire. Awesome!"
"January 13, 2015","I love the playlists and the fact that you can download them to your device to play when not in WiFi range!"
"June 16, 2014","I have been a Prime member for years and it's only getting better! Though there are lots of songs to choose from there's more I wish were there. Keep adding and it will only get better. Thanks, Patrick."
"February 18, 2013","Just what i needed the comfort of purchasing through amazon my favorite music! The prices are unbeatable , will definitely recommend to others"
"November 4, 2014","Read the other reviews and thought it can't be that bad. WRONG!! The app kept asking for credit card info and would not show me any music for sale without it. Uninstalled and shopping elsewhere."
"August 6, 2012","Won't update they keep asking for more and more permissions, big brother is monitoring and trying to control you device and data. JUST SAY NO."
"June 17, 2014","I like it. I was able to download some oldies in English and also some oldies in Spanish. I like the feature. I do not like songs that are not from the original author. I use it and love it."
"October 21, 2014","Nice benefit to being a prime member especially since it adds value for the customer at no additional cost. I especially like being able to download tracks to listen to when I am not on WIFI."
"October 8, 2014","App continuously crashes on OnePlus One. Unusable, and unfortunately Amazon puts DRM on the audio files so they can't be played by any other audio player. I should get a Prime discount :P"
"June 15, 2016","I loved, loved, loved it, thanks Amazon"
"October 28, 2014","Its great. I can pull up several bands that I had not heard in years to listen too. I have lots of CD's but the time it take to switch a dis is more than twice the time to switch on prime"
"January 15, 2013","Great app! Works well on my tablet. My Google Play doesn't always work. Will download more from Amazon apps. No problems found at all."
"April 25, 2011","it was working without a problem with motorola xoom until 4/25 update. it now foreclose and dont play any overcloud or song save on the tablet. its unstable.."
"August 28, 2013","I do not know about this product since I never use it. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause,but although this was added to a kindle, it is not used, so I cannot rate it fairly."
"February 7, 2013","I love to be able to listen to music and purchase music at the same time. Its also great to have access to the new releases or by genre even on my phone!!! Wonderful APP for an android!"
"October 23, 2014","This app isn't working. I've downloaded and deleted then downloaded again and still won't work!"
"December 17, 2016","Very good"
"March 18, 2015","A vast library of music that you can listen to all day long, commercial-free that you pick. Not some goofy algorithm that picks songs for you with advertisements every other song."
"February 19, 2013","Most impressive. I love this item with my computer/MP3 player, but added to my Galaxy S III, I am spellbound. Try it, you'll like it. Its easy. Absolutely a five star item. *****"
"April 13, 2015","Have not been able to figure out how to make this work on my computer. If it's not supposed to work on the computer, then it is crap, and your CEO should go flagellate himself."
"March 2, 2013","The system works quite well. It seems to work pretty much the same as I-tunes and the cloud saving that comes with it is wonderful as you can then access it from your other devices."
"June 3, 2012","This app is great, easy to use, and convenient! I can listen to my favorite songs anywhere, anytime. This is the best app I will ever download on my phone! Music is life! \m/"
"December 31, 2012","Have not really used it very often am currently using spotify....and am fairly satisfied with it before that I listened to you tube and I really don't see the need to pay for music"

"June 19, 2011","Amazon has really impressed me with their music store and system. Purchasing, downloading (and re-downloading, if you need to) are all simple. Playback is fairly simple, too.  What will make this the best (it's not there yet; I am aware of the limitations): - adjustable bit rate streaming - enhanced flexibility in the player (playlists, tag editing, etc.) - purchase streaming-only version for a fraction of the cost (enable upgrade later) - mark previous purchases as purchased, and inaccessible for re-purchase  Keep up the great work!"

Now you have to buy the song blindly without knowing if this is the song you were looking for or pay $7.99 a month to join one of their memberships for music which is not why I use this app. Nearly all my music is on this app which means I can't uninstall. It's all about profit. They want your money. Don't buy single songs every once in a while, no they want you to pay monthly for their services."

"June 17, 2014","I've noticed a lot of negativity due to lack of sd storage. Yes, you can't natively download to an sd card, however your phone should have a file manager where you can export to an sd card. If you've ever used a pc or mac this should be a simple concept. It's just like moving files from one folder to another. Your music player apps will read mp3 files from anywhere on your phone. It would be nice to have the option in the settings in order to eliminate a step, but sometimes we need to do things on our own and use a little thinking to get there."

"March 30, 2011","so why did I give 1 star? because its not really streaming. It's downloading the entire song into a cache file. So your music isn't really playing from the cloud. This is why people are getting errors when they first try to play the song they just bought, because you have to wait for it to download! if they can switch this to real streaming, then I'll make this a 5 star!"

"February 7, 2016","I got the app in December and got all my music organized, stored all on an SD card and playlists set up (which you can do only one song at a time), then shortly after it stopped reading most of the songs on the SD card. I had to redownload and resort the ""lost"" songs. Now it's done it again. It started by no longer reading the artist and album info, just the song title. Then it stopped reading the files altogether. Other music apps read and played the files fine. I see the song files on the card but the app won't play them. This time, my cloud too has only an odd assortment of purchased and already owned songs so i can't even redownload and there's no option to get the app to re-scan what's on the SD card, where the app itself put the files. Make sense?"
"October 28, 2014","You guys are listening. However maybe I missed it but can you back up your playlists that are created on an android device? If that is not already done that should be next."
"January 4, 2017","Love my music and have put it all in Amazon music player; even my odd mix CD's. I enjoy the free radio and many free songs. I don't need any other music app. It does it all."
"October 28, 2016","The previous version of the app was much more stable. Ever since they revamped the interface and launched the Unlimited service I have had problems with the streaming part of the app. It pauses after a few songs (even on my wifi) if it doesn't outright crash. Running it on Android 7 on a Nexus 6P."
"May 23, 2015","These are the cutest sandals I have seen and I had tried to order them last year but they were out-of-stock. So I reordered this year. They still are the cutest sandals and go with anything. Unfortunately, I have a high instep and with the strap being so far up my foot, I could not wear them. Rather than return them, I plan to pass them on to my cousin. Therefore the I rated them as a 4 for me when they are really a 5 star. The size was exact and shipping was swift with arrival on time. I'm just so disappointed that I can't wear these sandals."
"August 10, 2015","Two dr.'so came out with an album the same day most choose dre but need et in their life.. enough said."
"April 2, 2011","I could not find an easy way to play or shuffle and entire playlist or the entire library. The now playing buttons back and forth are to small. difficult to use in the car."
"May 18, 2011","at the end of every song it stops playing and says network lost even on wifi. super annoying and I stream Netflix over 3g with out a single stop so this is just unacceptable."
"November 12, 2011","Like so many others have said, streaming from the cloud is just amazing. Being able to free up my SD card was great. The cloud is def the way to go. Interface is simple -too simple. Plus the music prices are simply FANTASTIC.  Edit: I mistakenly selected 1 star. 5 stars is what I meant."
"December 5, 2015","Just received it yesterday and very disappointed. The case requires you to unscrew 6 small screws in the front to use insert your phone. It's not a standards size screw you would typically have a screwdriver for around the house. Hence, it will require you to purchase a screwdriver somewhere just to use the product. It also has no instructions and is a little heavier then expected."
"March 22, 2015","Excellent"
"May 13, 2015","The interface is terribly confusing and incredibly difficult to navigate. It's hard to figure out how to even get to your music. It's a resource hog. You can't control whether it downloads to your internal memory or SD card. If a download of purchased tracks fails (which it usually does) the ""Download Failed"" message can't be dismissed from your notifications regardless of whether or not the app is running (since some process of it is ALWAYS running). You have to reboot the phone in order to clear any stray items it leaves in your notifications.  Just give us something that lets us download the tracks we purchased so we can use whatever player we want."
"February 26, 2012","Amazon Mp3 is you could listen to music. Because it countine. To put all song. Music between Devie or could. We listen to both music."
"February 12, 2013","It was fairly easy but at the same time I had trouble downloading the music and had to try at lest 3 -4 time before it finally took.  I am more familiar with Amazon MP3 now."
"June 12, 2014","I tried to download this app into my Kindle Fire so that I may play music from Amazon Prime. I got it to work on my cell phone just fine, but how come I can't play Prime Music on my Kindle? Doesn't make much sense.  UPDATE 6/20/2014 - When I first posted this, it was not available on the first generation Kindle Fire, however the I.T. people got right on it and now us original owners have the benefit of Prime Music. Thanks Amazon!"
"September 26, 2017","Enjoy the variety of music and sound quality is great"
"February 13, 2013","AMAZON MP3 is the way to go! I use it everyday! Its the only way to buy mp3s. - *"
"June 17, 2014","If you are going to compete with I-tunes, it looks like you have come to the right place. This is a fantastic interface with almost limitless music. Prime users simply can't beat the price."
"July 3, 2014","This came already installed on my phone. I have yet to use it or explore the potential of the app, but I have been pleased with Amazon and suspect this will be a good app to have in the future"
"August 1, 2012","I'm a big Again fan in general. We have a kindle, three kindle fires and three Android phones in the family that heavily utilize Amazon apps. We have Amazon prime. We had the free upgraded cloud storage because of Amazon music purchases. But the cloud player really isn't worth the new $25/year, and the free 250-song limit is not going to cut it for us. So, we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music.  The Amazon mp3 app itself was ok, but never great. Leaving it is not a hard decision. Initially, I had imported all our music from iTunes. It copied the playlists, but nit the folder hierarchy, so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess. Streaming worked ok, but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection. So I ended up copying my most-listened-to music to my sd card, and the built-in music player works very well."
"December 21, 2012","This program doesn't work with Kindle Fire HD. I thought it would be a good app addition but, no luck."
"December 10, 2013","I used to love the app. It used to work well and it sounded wonderful playing in my cars speakers. I used to tell my friends about it but now....not so much. Ever since the last update it randomly ""stutters"" when playing a song or stops competely. I can't get it to clear off my phone after I turn it off. It has also become a pain to navigate. Before this last update I would have given the app 5 stars. I hope that they fix what they screwed up. No longer a fan."
"September 8, 2013","so..... Am I losing my hearing that I decide to use Chinese ?!? Dare u stop watching movies when u start talking Thai ?!?"
"February 11, 2013","I liked the fact that it was easy and quick to download. I am hoping to learn more about this app."
"July 22, 2015","I must go neutral on this....I can't really rate it properly as I have yet to utilize Prime Music. I have not once accessed the app or even listened to it. I'm sure it's great, I've just yet to access it."
"July 10, 2011","seamlessly works across my android my wife's android and our PCs.. I have the htc incredible and she has the incredible 2."
"May 23, 2015","I really can't say much about this. I downloaded it to my phone but, then lost my phone before even being able to test it out. Maybe I will download again in the future."
"October 11, 2016","Had install issues and was directed to install Audible (why?)...nonetheless it worked. Yea! However, after getting into my car, realized it no longer works our even shows up on Android Auto. Not my typical experience with Amazon, so 3 stars for release quality control."
"September 29, 2012","I basically just use this app for shopping or downloading. The irritating issue with this app is that you cannot set the default download location. As a result, if you have limited internal storage, storage space for your music becomes an issue. It would be much easier to store the music on an external SD card with more space. There are many users complaining about this issue for over a year but nothing has been done. This can't be that complicated."
"October 29, 2014","Great service but it is very confusing and difficult to navigate. Some kind of sound quality adjustment (EQ) would be good also."
"October 29, 2014","The app thinks I'm in the UK so no Prime service... I've contacted amazon about it but they have no idea and are no help"
"June 22, 2015","Nice compilation of songs but a few I liked are missing. Pretty typical with compilations but this is still a very good album"
"October 29, 2014","Just what you would expect from Amazon, nothing but the best."
"March 4, 2015","Great song (live version). Wish I could find the studio recording."

"April 8, 2017","I do not understand this app! Actually this whole Amazon prime music setup!! I got rid of my spotify to save 2 dollars a month but I'm not sure it was worth it! I think I messed something up signing out? How is that possible with the cloud??My music is just gone from my phone! It's on my computer but I can't even get to my subscription on my phone!!?? I'm signed in. I've searched and searched Amazon and Google trying to find answers and Nothing! So disappointed!"
"March 23, 2015","Beautiful music. My daughter and I loves it."
"October 29, 2014","Haven't figured it out, yet."
"March 22, 2015","Nice app and Prime Music is a great deal"
"January 13, 2015","I have been using the Amazon Music App on my Tablet pretty much since it became available. I am a prime member and I downloaded tons of free free Prime music to my device to listen while at work and not connected to the internet. This served me well for many months and while I knew my downloaded prime music could only be played via the Amazon Music App, this was not a problem for me since I carry my tablet pretty much everywhere I go.  However just today I load up the Amazon Music App as I always do at work and I eventually discovered that the app was only playing music I already had (meaning songs I didn't download from Amazon). I have my entire library on random so after the 20th track of very old music, I discovered that all the prime music I downloaded to my device was no longer in any of my playlists. I verified that the mp3s themselves were still on my device (why wouldn't they be?), yet this stupid app no longer sees them when I'm offline. Even albums I've purchased from Amazon no longer appear in this app. I verified that the albums I downloaded was still available for prime members, (System of a Down, 311, Disturbed, etc), yet for some reason the app doesn't want to play them anymore unless I'm connected to the internet.  If I connect to the internet, then viola!! all my downloaded content plays. But think about this for a moment, what is the purpose of downloading for ""offline play"" if I can only play them when I'm online? I don't know what changed but an app that worked so well is now broken and pretty much useless for what I use it for. I'm not going to connect my tablet to my cellular network for the 8 - 10 hours I'm at work just because Amazon decided to break something.  This is incredibly ridiculous, and the so called help videos on Amazon.com are about as useful as ____ on a bull, and the only somewhat useful suggestion of refreshing your music library doesn't work. My only other option is to redownload all my music that I ALREADY did to get this to work again, but I might not even bother because in 6 months it will probably break again."
"May 24, 2016","I like its customizable folders album and artist options, but it sucks up WAY too much data to be regularly useful.  Update October 2016  I finally got used to the process of uploading and customizing, and they changed the whole thing, preventing the organizing of folders, songs, albums as we would like. Now it is virtually useless and unwieldy, with side bars expanding, and extremely difficult to simply look through folders.  This is absolutely terrible. If I hadn't spent so much time putting stuff on to it, I would never use nor continue with it."
"March 23, 2015","Awesome"
"March 22, 2015","Nice"
"June 23, 2015","easy and fun"
"June 12, 2014","How is it possible that an Amazon app not work on your own device. It doesn't even show on my app cloud! How can I use Music Prime on my tablet? I wish there was a way to give it no stars."
"March 12, 2017","It dais amazon music is free if you have prime. I can't seem to access it."
"February 27, 2012","Dosent let me download this app absolutley realy realy realy realy realy realy realy realy realy realy realy realy realy srinks."
"March 2, 2012","dont waste your time. this app stinks. I love free things but the app is free because all of the songs coast money."
"April 13, 2015","Ok, I don't have alot of experience with these sort off things. But I just got my update notice, and it scared the heck outta me. I had no idea that their permissions allowed them to have as much, if not more, access to do as much as I do on my phone-and other devices. Why do we have to allow them to, set up accts, delete accts, use all our google accts at will, change and delete apps and other data, and on and on... Am I a bit more of a dummy than I thought? Why on earth would they need people to agree to things I would let my own mother have access to? Well, maybe mom... Lol If anyone can help me make sense of this, I could really use the eye opener. But I really can't see myself going for it... Shaking my head..."
"November 20, 2016","Thought this was included with prime .. won't even open."
"December 2, 2016","I am very tech savvy and have used many types of media management apps and software. This is possibly the worst interface ever, especially on PC. It is slow, sluggish, and difficult to navigate. The screen is so cluttered, you can't find anything. When playing a playlist on a PC, you can't even read the song title."
"September 5, 2015","I only recently started using the Prime Music app, & after uploading my own music (matched by Amazon) & finding some Prime music that I was happy to find is available (free w/ Prime), am very happy with Amazon Music thus far. I briefly tried Google Music, & two popular music streaming apps (Pandora, & Songza), and my Amazon Music experience has been infinitely better. I had a few technical questions initially (re: uploading my music, using PC & iPhone, etc.) that weren't addressed online, & support for Amazon Music was available right away, very knowledgeable & spot on (I now realize) as far as recommendations made. Now that I'm routinely playing music & adding or deleting individual songs from my library, etc., my impression is that more thought and planning went into the design and functionality of Amazon Music than the other options I've explored. It's very intuitive; graphics are very professional & consistent; it's very responsive (I've not (yet, anyway) experienced any lag or technical glitches); there's no annoying behavior by the app to aggressively ""encourage"" you to buy music unless you've expressed that interest; and - one feature I really appreciate - no ads (pop-up or otherwise). Quality of stream is excellent. My impression is that Amazon (wisely) realizes that this app nicely integrates with their business model, & complements their core mission; that is, if the app works well & people have a very nice experience, it becomes a very ""sticky"" service (i.e., enhances loyalty & overall impressions of Amazon, & encourages more people to join (or continue their membership with) Prime). In any event, they've done a very nice job designing & implementing this service (& accompanying app), & I'm really enjoying it."
"March 6, 2017","Pros: -Okay music selection. Had a fair amount of music that I enjoy (mostly have metal/death metal added, no other genre) -Free with Prime Subscription -Offline listening  Cons: -If you want a lot more to choose from, you need an additional subscription -Having lyrics up causes memory issues (tons of lag) on my device after a short period of time  Final thoughts: Extended music library shouldn't be something that costs extra. And if you insist on charging extra, mark down the price please. Overall, a nice app that does what it's supposed to."
"November 5, 2016","Hardly any control over media. You can't even use it in the background or capture media while in other apps like Snapchat. Don't even bother purchasing from Amazon music anymore. Stick to iTunes. Thumbs way down."
"April 21, 2016","Stopped the ability to play DL Prime content without verifying first, which isn't the point of offline playback. Offline recordings cached well with a data connection, but like I said in the first sentence this isn't the definition of Offline playback.  Cleared cache, reinstalled, etc. to no avail. Guess I'm paying for Google Play again even though I already have paid for my Prime."
"March 15, 2017","STILL stops randomly, even on downloaded songs. STILL crashes my computer. Music STILL suddenly becomes unavailable without warning. STILL have to pay for some songs, even with Prime & music subscription."
"April 29, 2017","I have to pay even more money to listen music? My prime membership isn't enough??"
"November 15, 2016","I paid $100 for my fire TV and $50 for the game controller and Amazon issues and update that makes me hunt through nested menus for purchased music that was originally accessible from the home screen. Updates are supposed to make apps easier to use not harder with more fees. If I start seeing advertisements the app I'm gonna demand a refund for my fire TV. The best word to describe the Amazon music cloud is ""volatile"". I literally lost purchased music because Amazon stopped the album. Even uploaded music is subject to the volatility of Amazon's music market. If Amazon made a straight up media player app they would not have a problem. I download everything I buy because I can't trust Amazon to keep it for me."
"December 30, 2016","This service has been atrocious. Only iTunes is worse. Although iTunes can handle more than 40k songs...... I am a person who has a huge audio collection, and I own an echo, so I'm forced to use Amazon Music for my server to upload my music so I can listen to it on my echo's. This has been a cluster since I was in the beta.... every time they upgrade, it gets worse and worse. After this last update, when I open it, I get an error message that says there is no disk in the drive, and It wont go away, and Amazon Music locks up..... can't use it at all. I've uninstalled and re-installed, and it does the same. About six months ago I called in for support, and they said it could not handle over 40K songs, but I was only at 33K. Still they said it was due to high song amount. I pay amazon so that I'm supposed to be able to upload up to 250K songs. That is not even the worst. I have a compilation set with 4 albums, and Amazon made a different album for each song. It is fraught with issues all the way through, and I have been telling amazon for almost a year about these issues, and it just keeps getting worse. I hope they fix it someday, as I love the Echo... but can't stand this program."
"April 4, 2016","This app has a fair amount of music. Amazon music unlimited does have a fair amount more, but it is a good selection for a free app (with a prime membership). There is a small glitch that causes the app to not play the song you selected at first when you change albums, but when you select it again it works. It has music stations and albums to download. All and all it is worth a download if you have a prime membership. If you do not have a prime membership I would use google play music, because it seems to have less glitches."
"May 7, 2017","So now we have to pay more for prime but lose the music? What a scam......PRIME IS DEAD. I will not pay for it again."
"October 12, 2016","Worked fine until recently and now it crashes/stops working 4-5 times a day, slowing down my LG G2 while it does so. Tried uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing data/cache and still does the same thing. See that a lot of other people are have the same problem lately. Please fix it."
"April 15, 2017","Last update doesn't work. My musoc doen not play anymore! Fix this please!"
"January 16, 2015","I have purchased 894 songs from 146 albums. When I purchase new music it is simply impossible to tell what has already been downloaded. ""Drag music here to download?"" WHAT??? This is a computer for crying out loud. Can't you TELL ME what hasn't already been downloaded? Present me with a list? DOWNLOAD ALL???  Drag to a list to download? I WANT IT ALL OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT!!!  Amazon music is the worst program I have EVER run into, and I have been in computers since 1972. THE WORST I have ever run into!  It appears that they want us to leave everything on the cloud, make play lists and stream it off the cloud. The problem with that is that mostly I send it to my tablets and my phone, which I then listen to in my car or out in public. The tablets only ever have an internet connection in my house. My phone has to pay BIG BUCKS for data to stream music I already own.  Streaming may work just fine sitting at my desk in my home over a broadband, but it just doesn't work AT ALL out in the world. I need to download to my devices. ALL OF THEM! All my music.  Let me repeat, AMAZON MUSIC is the WORST program I have EVER RUN INTO. And I have run into some reaaaaaalllly bad crap.  Sadly, Amazon doesn't care, nor do they read these comments, so this is just an exercise in expressing my frustration.  Buying the music is dead simple, and I like to support the artists, and listen to the music I love. Buy getting it to my devices.  WOOF, what nightmare!!!"
"June 12, 2014","Amazon.does it AGAIN, tempting us with services they CANNOT provide. If you have some other device, MAYBE it will work. All I know is, it is majority frustrating to be offered "" millions of songs- FREE!"" only to find the app I need to.play said songs DOES NOT WORK ON KINDLES. YOU SUCK AMAZON. Better to not.even.offer."
"November 30, 2016","I just finished with an ordeal with Amazon and my kindle hdx. At this point I couldn't be more disappointed as I am right now. Wait! Yes I can be more disappointed. Yes I am! After being talked into getting a new kindle bc they claimed my warranty was up and I disagreed with them but I was losing a no win situation. So I decide it invest once again, in another kindle. Seeing that the hdx is no lonher available (or so I was told), I decided to try the HD 10, thinking it was gonna be better that the HDX. I couldn't be more wrong. The one thing I looked forward to was getting back into my music. Come to find out that the HD 10 doesn't allow you to purchase music to add to your collection. So now I'm forced to purchase music from my phone and sync it to my kindle. That's if I decide to keep.it. It already has one strike against..wait no, two strikes against them.Just found out that I can't even download the Amazon Music app into said Kindle, it said it was 'unavailable'...'Una..who? This gets better and better. A total waste. I feel for everyone who's experiencing this too. Both investments the kindle and the actual music is about to go 'Bye Bye'. I just know it! And I'm not a happy can per right about now, not that amazon really cares. As long as they get the money, it's all.good...."
"August 12, 2017","I was told with prime membership i could get music too. This is not the case. They want me to pay more for the music. No. I will now delete the app"
"May 5, 2015","I had to DELETE this App, because my Norton App Adviser informed me that Amazon was accessing my SIM card info. I looked at the permissions, but Amazon says nothing about this. Ultimately, I trust Norton over Amazon. There is no GOOD reason for Amazon.com to access all of our SIM cards. I did make a complaint to the developers for what it's worth. This makes me reconsider renewing PRIME when it comes time. I sadly, spent alot of time and energy adding to my Amazon Music collection and now I cannot use it."
"August 19, 2017","Since the latest update this app has become the biggest piece of trash that ever came out! Where do I begin here? Lack of staying on the lock screen when paused or not automatically resuming when you receive and end a phone call! Prime music being unable to find, horrible searching abilities! I am on the verge of cancelling my amazon prime music and going with something else since some idiot screwed up a perfectly functional app!!! I listen to my music while driving in my driving job, and this piece of garbage has become so un-user friendly! I can't keep messing with it while driving, it needs to work as it used to. They need to fire the jerk that messed this app up! I need the apk file and complete instructions for install and BLOCKING this newest update piece of trash from ever getting into my phone!"
"October 19, 2017","What a terrible service! We already pay $105/year for Amazon Prime, so you'd think the company wouldn't stiff us with ridiculous tactics like graying out songs on my playlists, which I can't play unless I upgrade to the monthly subscription music service! (Why provide the ""free"" service then? (Meaning, the service we already pay $105/year for, in our Amazon Prime membership? And why does the company gray out other songs in my playlist, saying ""this song is no longer available."" ??? A song out of copyright, and more than 70 years old? Really? I believe this is the lowest scummy sort of pressure to try to make customers switch to the paid service. Tell you what. I'm leaving Amazon Prime music and will be very happy paying whatever Spofity charges. I hear they have more songs anyway. Amazon has nothing by Led Zeppelin for example. This Amazon Prime Music is fatally flawed by the company's greed and stupidity."
"January 6, 2014","This app is a huge resource hog. It has a setting called ""refresh cloud library"" that runs EVERY 10 min whether you want it or not. The setting does not give you the option to disable that check or even change the time interval. Hate apps that don't let you control if/when they run and drain your battery."
"January 5, 2016","I was expecting a bit more from this app.Don't get me wrong though,it's not entirely terrible.A few things I liked about it was the addition of lyrics to some songs and how simple it was to look for music and buy an artist's album. However,I did experience some issues.The fact that when I was listening to a song and lost my internet connection, the song would start all over and you're forced to listen to the entire song all again once connection has been restored.Another thing I disliked about Prime Music was the fact that there's not many artists.Only really known ones.One of the things that really bugged me a bit was the fact that the app needed a lot of my private information.Like no thank you.I ended up uninstalling the app for that reason and since it took up a lot of space on my phone.I'd rather stick to Pandora."
"September 16, 2016","I've been using Amazon Music for quite a while now and I have to say that I have seen constant improvements with every update. This is a perk that is not to be treated as an extra for your prime membership but a highlight of it. One special note is that you are allowed up to 10 devices but if you call Amazon and explain that you no longer have some of those devices they are more than accommodating. The selection of music has become very impressive and adding music to your library is easy and intuitive. I like the premade playlists that they offer and even if I do not add that particular playlist to my library I have the option to add any individual song in that playlist to my library. Amazon music works very well on all my devices and computers. It is truly a great value added service."
"June 16, 2016","Did not care for the requirement to buy a separate subscription. We have Amazon Prime on my wife's phone and shared to my phone. I wanted to add music to my phone as I am the only driver and it would be nice to have ""our"" music to play from the phone through our car's enfotainment system. The attempted setup of a library for music required that I pay for another subscription. Definitely not worth another $99. Cannot say how the service works. Unhappy"
"November 30, 2014","Your app is very limited that sometimes it gets close to absurdity.  1. I expended over a $100 in your store to get a 128GB memory card. I have not taken advantage of it because your app doesn’t allow specifying in which folder I want the music to be downloaded. I have to maneuver and keep transferring the music manually which is really aggravating. At times, if I have no done a recent transfer to the memory card and I will not be at home in a while, I’m in such need of memory that I have to clear the whole Amazon music from my phone. The start the whole process again.  2. To free up memory from my device, I selected the voicemails messages to be downloaded to the memory card. Your app makes them part of the library. Worse than that, I can’t delete them all at once or better, just delete them from the library but keep them stored in my phone. At times I had deleted over 20 voice mails one by one from the app library. That how stupid it becomes.  3. Same as #2, I have downloaded complete playlists from Prime. I discover songs that I don’t like and I don’t know how to get rid of them while keeping the rest of the library intact.  4. I can't play my music offline and wasting my cell phone data streaming. When I try to play music supposedly downloaded to my cellphone, I get an error message with a ""Exception #180"" code  It is such a painful waste of time when you can solve that in less than an hour. That is why you hire software engineers and geeks. Any of them can take care of all of the above during lunch time."
"May 11, 2016","As someone who has used quite a lot of different apps with musical capabilities, for work as a musician and personal use, I can say with confidence that this is the worst app for listening to music it has ever been my misfortune to be forced to use. Force closes for no reason, terrible organization, storage and RAM hog, causes phone to freeze to the point that I have to sometimes take the battery out to restart it, and the load time for songs in my offline library is ridiculously long. Seeing as this is the only way to listen to songs with my mobile device through Amazon Prime, I guess I'm stuck with this crappy app. Otherwise I am going to use the slightly less glitchy Google play music. Seeing as I am paying for this mangled service, and assume some of my payment is going to app development, I'm highly disappointed in the quality of this particular of service from Amazon. Good music selection, but difficult to listen to and enjoy if the app doesn't work."
"May 20, 2016","I can't move it to my SD card. Most mobile devices have pretty limited primary storage, and mobile service providers tend to wantonly lay waste to what limited storage there is with useless apps that cannot be removed. It's pretty inconsiderate of an app developer to force an app to stay on the main device storage unless the user roots the phone, which can have serious consequences when coupled with certain service providers. I really do like the app, but it's a serious space hog and there just isn't enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for apps that can't be moved to the SD card. If you update it, and check the box in Android Studio that allows the user to move it to the SD card, I'll be more than happy to use it."
"August 5, 2015","This app takes a minute to work through the intricacies but that's bc it does SO MUCH! I wanna address 2 complaints I read abt 'no external SD support.' & that it limits u to 500 songs per playlist & that made the app a piece of crap. Okay, so 1st off, 500 songs is like 3 Days worth of music. I have a playlist with 48 songs = 5 hrs of music. Does anyone's phone even hold a charge for 3 days straight?? if u streamed that much media on your phne straight the battery would heat up so hot & prbly melt the phne. So, to me that's a useless comment & irrelevant. The other issue: I like that all the music us stored in the Cloud & it doesn't use ANY Storage space on my device. If u own the music u can download to ur device (it's fast!) to play offline if u ever get stuck or just don't want to use data. And, YOU CAN MOVE THE FOLDERS 2 an external SD card if u have an Android (Samsung S5 user here). it works just like moving files on a computer. The hitch is this: u can download aNY of the music u want. However, u can only move the music you own. Amazon streams the music in 2 different formats: MP3 & MP4. It downloads in MP3 if u own it. Then u can move to an SD card & the app will find it & play it. MP4 music has to stay with the app on the phones internal storage. Hopefully, most ppl get the obtuse reasons for this, so you can't transfer & steal music u haven't purchased. I personally think this is a great app & that Amazon Prime is better than sliced bread. I'm a true believer."
"September 13, 2017","As of the latest 7.1.2 version this stand alone app records audio without permission and no way to turn it off. I have no use at all for this ""feature"". This is not an Alexa, tap, or even a Kindle app, this is on the Android version used on phones. No choice for consumers means no value to consumer. Time to move on and find a better player that let's me choose how I consume my media. Last two updates have had spotty connection. This was last nail in the coffin."
"June 8, 2017","Use this app almost daily. Love that we can create our own stations to listen to. Totally like there are no commercials to listen to. But there are 2 complaints I have though. If you put a song in twice by mistake it won't let you delete one of them unless it deletes both from the app. There needs to be a way to just delete a copy. Also when I travel I may be listening to directions and turn it off . As soon as I restart my car starts it comes on / even if I don't turn it on. And if I turn it off and make a phone call it will automatically cone back on. There is just a glitch were it comes on without turning it on that could be fixed. But I love the music and so do my grandchildren. We all have our favorite stations. Highly recommend this Amazon App!"
"September 18, 2017","Numerous issues with this app. Music not playing (with errors), including music that ""I Own"". Creates duplicate offline playlists EVERY time you download music to device. Very inconsistent loudness levels across albums / artists. Limited features when connected to modern vehicle entertainment systems compared to competitive music streaming services. And, I'm a Music Unlimited subscriber!  Amazon Support virtually useless. It's a vicious, yet ""very polite"" circle of getting absolutely NOTHING done. I've sent app logs so many times I can click through my phone blindly in a matter of seconds. Amazon Support has yet to act or provide a ""we found a problem"" response.  Send logs; Provide more info; Thank you, now please call us; Thanks for the call, please provide more written information; Sorry for these problems, please send us your log files --- then REPEAT Indefinitely.  Over 4-weeks of this and no solutions. One of the support engineers I spoke to also experiences similar issues with the app, so why are these issues not addressed / corrected?"
"December 7, 2013","used to be a terrific app, but the latest build has made it remarkably useless. i see the new update comes with the ability to share what i'm listening to facebook. thanks, but no thanks. i don't need or want people to see what i'm listening to. what i want is the old player whose widget worked and that didn't lag when playing from the cloud."
"June 8, 2016","I've been a member of Prime for a really long time. And a user of the Music app since it first appeared. And maybe the problem is specific to the Fire HD 10? It seems to work fine on my desktop - but I'm not going to risk testing it either since I'm talking about thousands of songs which are only manageable with playlists. After a few weeks of listening to my music offline, which is a mix of purchased prime and my own collections of CD songs, the player starts skipping over certain/ random purchased Prime songs. Of course they are the ones I listen to the most. Flashbacks of digital rights usage? Clearing the cache does nothing, syncing does nothing. Support had me delete the data which fixes the playback but it also deletes the playlists. Playlists that constitutes hours if not days of music - gone - poof! The option to download the cloud playlist does not work past 1 to 3 songs. Transferring a large music library from my computer is best done directly on the SD card with a card reader as the USB cable option hangs up pretty quickly. Transfer of purchased music results in duplicates on the device. Oh sure, I remember which one is which since the last century. The Amazon Music player must keep the playlists internal to itself rather than isolated and safe? It would make so much more sense to have those playlists synchronisable wouldn't it? Reminds me of when ms quit selling music, their player crapped out and amz stepped in."
"March 5, 2015","Either Amazon did not think to allow the transfer of downloaded prime music to an SD card, or it purposefully prevents such transfers. While the latter is more egregious, both are unforgivable. A few lines of simple coding (if that) would solve the problem but so far there is no indication that Amazon is working to do that. Are you? Hint to Amazon: ""free"" prime music is not free. Your prime customers are paying a hefty annual fee for the privilege. Second hint: even if the music is transferred to an SD card, which admittedly could allow easier movement to another device, Amazon still could code it to prevent access if the user is not signed into a valid prime account, so what does it matter? For your (tens of) thousands of customers who have limited data plans and devices with minimal internal memory, this is a huge problem. We are not always connected to wifi and therefore cannot always access your ""cloud"" to listen to our prime music. Fix this glaring problem and this review goes to five stars, because the ease of downloading prime music and the sound quality are impressive. Thanks."
"March 16, 2016","For the most part I am enjoying Prime music--both my library and streaming. Prior to Amazon Prime Music, I mainly used Pandora and Spotify. It is quite obvious that Amazon Prime Music caters to the white, middle-class, mom demographic with the layout and the selection of music. As a millennial I am definitely more drawn to Spotifiy's playlists and classifications for genres. I have a feeling I will grow to love Amazon Prime during my 1-year subscription. However, I was turned off by my initial observation of the main demographic to which Amazon caters. So far, I am thoroughly enjoying no ads and the option to download playlists, albums, and songs to my library to listen to offline. That is a big deal for me since I have a small data plan and limited access to Wifi. I'm definitely willing to tryout as much as I can on Prime during my first year of paid access. At this point in time as a business woman and a graduate student, I feel that the $50/year student membership fee is not worth it and most definitely not the regular membership fee."
"October 21, 2016","This was a good app but the past few months i have not been able to update it. I unistalled it and tried reinstalling it. Keep getting a error 505. Have the samsung s6 edge and still have trouble with this app. This is the only one i have problems with. Hope they get it fixed soon or ill be downloading another music app."
"June 14, 2014","I was very excited when I learnt that Amazon has decided to allow streaming of most of the popular music for Prime Members like me but my excitement did not last very long when I found several bugs & limitation in this Amazon Music app for Android. Granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed.  The most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it (External SD card) it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage.  It is never practical to be connected to Wi-Fi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage, it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed. I am sure eventually Amazon will release updates to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablets.  Also, there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer service and the downloaded songs do not play. Even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re-download the songs till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounters download errors (Which it does on a regular basis) you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re-download again or try again and again which is very frustrating.  Also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling. The Song title does not match with the song it is playing, The album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs, the Equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on...  It is indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to Prime Members but this APP should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working APP.  I am rating this with 2 stars currently but I am positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly.  Thanks for reading my review."
"November 11, 2017","The Amazon music app is okay. I use it almost everyday. I'm content with the selection provided-occassionaly frustrated by an album I can't listen to. There have been a few errors with the program I've experienced. But, the most egregious is the load time for me to access my music. Somedays I'll hop in my car, excited to listen to some tunes. I click on the app. And I wait a moment. Then some more moments...and it's still loading.  So, a little frustrated, I'll start driving. It couldn't take that long could it?  Sometimes it'll come up after maybe 5 minutes or so. Other times- 15 minutes down the road- The screen still hasn't popped up.  Usually. After reaching my destination, I'll close all screens on my phone log then reopen the program and everything is cool. I do not know about programing, though I know I have a higher end phone, so I can't say 100% who's at fault here- but from the looks of it- others have the same problem with this app.  Anyhow. I'll likely keep using it. I've been roped in with prime- this is basically free- only a few bucks a month- and I can listen to albums after whatever procedures I've come across.  It's not convenient. I don't like it. But it'll do."
"January 17, 2014","This app insists on putting all your music on the phone's internal storage. There is no way to move it to the SD card. Therefore, the amount of music you can have with you is bound by the unchangeable internal memory rather than an SD card which can be 32GB or larger.  This problem has been known for YEARS. The developers have deliberately ignored it. They simply don't care about how useless this idiotic, pointless restriction makes the app.  Amazon is pretty good at a lot of things, but when it comes to this app, it's amateur hour."
"June 2, 2017","It has some good music but the selection sucks. The songs I want are there . For a subscription service that is included with prime it should have a much larger database of music to choose from . I can download music to my phone or use Pandora with so much more ease and not get a headache"
"April 2, 2014","I've been buying music and streaming it via Cloud Player for a couple of years now. Now I finally decided to try to download all of it (so I can put it in the car), and wow, what a mistake.  I have just 974 tracks totaling about 6GB. Using the Mac version of Amazon's MP3 downloader, I'm now starting the fourth attempt with no hope of success in sight. The first two attempts ended with the downloader simply crashing partway through. Absolutely pathetic that such a simple piece of software, which shouldn't even be necessary in the first place, wouldn't be able to do its job. It's not smart enough to simply pick up where it left off, either, so you need to delete everything before trying again otherwise you'll end up with multiple copies of any files unfortunate enough to be part of the first, failed download.  On the third attempt it managed to download all 974 files without crashing. Celebrations were premature, however, as it turns out a random 50% of the files were stored with cut off names. For example, a file name that should have been ""01. Track Name.mp3"" would end up just being called ""01. Track N"", with half the name and the .mp3 extension just missing. Again, the only thing I can do is delete the entire 6GB download and start again, crossing my fingers really hard this time. Thank goodness I'm not paying for bandwidth.  It's difficult to imagine that someone could have fouled up a piece of software so simple by accident. The only plausible explanation is that Amazon is deliberately shipping this broken program in the hopes of discouraging people from downloading the music they purchase, hoping they'll give up and resort to streaming it forever instead. Considering that the music is sold to us with the promise that it can be easily downloaded, this is nothing less than a blatant bait and switch scheme."
"December 1, 2015","While I love the music the app on my Samsung Note 3 is terrible. It fails repeatedly. It give me a message with a code and tells me to contact customer service. Why does the app not send this report itself? Once the error starts it is hard to even clear as it just keeps retrying the function and errors out again. Today I was just trying to edit a playlist. I have to reboot the phone after I add or delete 3 or 4'songs as the errors start. I don't want to call customer service. Oddly now as I poke around it seems picking up the phone is my only option. Nowhere is the online chat support? Send a text or email?"
"June 19, 2014","I like Amazons cloud and being able to upload (for free) your own music and download it on any device. While it wasnt my go to music app, because it was limited, it still did what it did very well.  With the addition of free music for prime members how ever it feels that the weakness of the app's design has appeared. Prime members get a mix of; bad, ok, excellent choices of free music to choose from. Im a progressive house/trance fan so my selection is super limited. Im not one for modern day pop music.  I know millions of people are okay hearing a song for the 30th time on the radio and for some reason add it to their playlist for more future listening. But I dont like that type of music. So I must depend on browsing for music. Prime music makes it really hard because the music I KNOW I want to hear isnt free so I wish Prime can introduce me to music I may want to hear that is available to prime members. Currently the only way to introduce listeners to new music is by listening to other peoples play list. Which so far I have found nothing I fully enjoy. And it seems you cant manipulate the playlist that easily. The user interface makes it difficult to add/delete music. Is the music I downloaded on my phone via a playlist totally tied to just that playlist or is it in my music library?  *In addition I found that even searching for music even with knowing an artist makes finding prime music a pain. While typing in an artist on my PC (which by the way you can only sample songs when using amazon.com but you can search, meanwhile amazons music program lets you play a full song added to your library but you can search for songs outside of your library) I found that not all the songs for prime were listed when typing in the artists name. I had to type in the song individually to get that result.  All in all it is a smooth start for Prime. Very little bugs.  Pros: Not laggy and no bugs yet Free Music Great launch for Prime Pop music for the masses.  Cons: Hodge podge of song selections makes finding music you want to listen to more annoying. Music discovery is dependent on other peoples playlist. No I dont want to listen to Nicky Romero, Pitbull, and Armin all at once. Please add an intelligent radio program so to help you find music that fits your taste UI is bit difficult and getting to the songs you want to listen to a bit tedious. Too much clicking add/delete songs from playlists is confusing"
"September 27, 2014","This app is an absolute mess. If and when it works properly, it will only work that way for a short period of time. For those who were familiar with Amazon's previous mp3 app (which worked great), this an ""upgraded"" version of that app that's just completely missed the mark.  I will give the one positive of this app is that you can quickly move between device and cloud. So if you have created playlists or Amazon Prime playlists, you can easily get those. That's really where my enthusiasm for this app ends.  My current issues with this app:  - Freezing - This app freezes constantly. I listen to music each morning/afternoon as I ride the train to and from work. Each time I boot up the app, it will be at my last play point, freeze, give me the stopped working message, and then reboot again always at the Cloud/Albums page.  - Unresponsive Controls - It happens fairly often where I will hit the skip button and nothing happens. It's actually more like I hit it 12 times before I give up. Finally when I accept that I can't skip a song the app catches up and quickly skips past 12 songs.  - Unresponsive Quick Bar - When in the Songs screen, the quick bar that allows you to move between different letters will be touch and go if it works. And it never fails, it always stops working when I'm on a song with the letter A and decide a song with the letter T would be better.  - Playlists that don't shuffle or shuffle when they feel like it.  - Always have to choose repeat and shuffle. Sometimes, you just know the song you want to start with. Every time I hand pick a song I always have to re-choose repeat and shuffle, or it will just start going in order. The previous Amazon mp3 player always remembered my selection.  I will admit most of my complaints are, when isolated, an annoyance. But those annoyances occur daily and add up fast. The only reason I continue to use this app is because I've invested a lot into Prime and Prime Music. I will admit, Amazon has me over a barrel on this one.  If you don't have a huge investment in Prime Music and you're just looking for a music app, definitely look elsewhere.  If improvements and fixes are made to the app, I will come back and update my review."
"August 8, 2015","As a Prime member we always try and explore new music. Initially there was a bit of a curve to sort it all out. But as with all Amazon products, interact and select the suggestions as well as various a ratios station's and samples. Amazon-Amazing analytical tools as well as their buyers and Brand merchants will soon learn your likes and open new worlds."
"July 30, 2017","Nice app. Easy to use, no ads. Good value if you are a prime member. Streaming, off line, individual songs, stations, thumbs up/thumbs down. It has per-existing play lists or you can create your own. Minuses? Not many. I wish it would remember the station I was listening to and return to it after I turn it off and then turn it back on again.  Ali Julia review"
"August 6, 2017","Someone told me if I had Amazon Prime I could stream music using my account...in the end the truth is I was assaulted by repeated offers to pay more money to join music unlimited and could not play anything that I had not already purchased. What a disappointment."
"June 13, 2014","I only want certain songs downloaded to my kids' devices and I don't want them to be able to purchase music. With the previous version, I could log in on their device, download the song they wanted, and then log out. They could easily find and play their songs. After the most recent update, I can't figure out how to get to their songs without being logged in. When you open the app, it prompts you to log in before you can do anything. I tried just finding their music and playing it through android's music player, but amazon songs don't show up as music. I was able to dig around and find them, but it was a hassle. I can choose the amazon player to play each song individually, but the other functions don't seem to work. I have to go through the file system for each song. At least once I did that, my device recognized the files as music so I can use the android music player. UGH."
"November 15, 2016","Same old music, just different station names. Since the new update, it no longer connects to my Ford Sync, just bluetooth audio. The push to get people to pay for this service leaves the music that is provided to Prime members very lacking. Don't try to force me me to pay more money, I promise you I won't pay, I'll just leave you, there are plenty of other services out there."
"July 1, 2014","Why did they break my Amazon Music app??? i had playlists set up and I didn't have to have an inet connection to listen...now they are gone and I'm not able to find any of my music playlists or music I had downloaded!! Dug out my old sandisk and using that again. Bad move Amazon! I won't use iTunes so now I'm in search of a different provider. great job - you just lost a customer."
"September 27, 2015","This application is terrible in almost every way. All I want is a quick way to take all of my music online and off and create playlists. Uploading my existing music is a dicey proposition with the Amazon Music Importer app, but even after I've got that done there's no way to get this app to respect my folder structure, so when browsing by (say) Artist I've got tons of single song artists because the metadata gives equal priority to guests and primary artists.  Searching isn't terrible, except that when I change tabs and want to get back to going down my list at, say, ""m"" there's no way to do so other than scrolling down. Type 'm' and I'm moved to a different search tab. This isn't rocket science, the conventional way of navigating a list by typing the first letter has worked perfectly for ages and what you're this app is doing isn't better.  Really though everything would be forgiven if it were a slick and fast app once I got in there. Problem is it's laggy and freezes up with barely a touch. There's a good app in here somewhere but I cringe every time I'm forced to use it when (say) interacting with my Echo."
"January 7, 2016","Finally this lousy app allows you to download the music YOU OWN directly to your MicroSD card, which I understand was a problem with Android, not Amazon (the problem occurred with many other non-Amazon apps).  That being said... this app still needs major work.  DLs of music I bought/own don't always work, but there's no indication from the app that they didn't complete. So you think you have the whole song, and instead you have only half or less.  On top of that, it is SUCH A PAIN to try to delete and reDL the song, because this must be done from completely different screens and requires stepping back through multiple menus. It is neither easy nor intuitive.  As a Prime user, I'm allowed to DL some Prime music I *don't* own for offline listening. Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't. The app won't tell you why.  There's no way to remove the gaps between songs the way they would sound if playing a CD or album. There are FREE apps that let you do this or let you crossfade, which this app also doesn't let you do.  There's NO graphic equalizer. Again, there are free music player apps that do this!"
"August 12, 2016","Many Prime songs and albums to choose from. You can build your own playlist and listen to it off-line (airplane mode to save battery life) if you download. You are not required to purchase music to build a playlist although I purchase my favorites to listen to on my mp3 player or memory stick while camping. However since my LG-G3 updated last night (08-11-16), the app is missing and will not install from Google Play Store or the Amazon site. Thankfully, I still have it on my tablet."
"July 7, 2014","I am a huge fan and used of Amazon Prime- originally for the 2 day shipping and for the last year+ for streaming video. When the price jumped 25%, the general consensus was that Amazon would be adding another killer benefit to make up for it- and so it was when Amazon Prime Music was announced. I loaded up on albums I hadn't listened to in years, and marveled at the bargain that Amazon Prime represents.  My daughter just got a new Android phone- a brand new, very recent model, relatively capable Android phone, with a brand new 16GB SD card (purchased via Amazon Prime!) installed. Amazon Prime Music was the second application loaded onto it- in fact it was a and she sat on the couch, delightedly perusing all the music she now had available.  A few hours later the phone was staggering, and a quick check revealed the culprit- the internal memory was almost entirely occupied by Amazon Prime Music's data. Thinking that it ws just a matter of directing the data to the still empty SD card, I first perused the settings and then did some internet research revealed that this is not an option- the app only write to the internal memory. The 'Clear Cache' option helped for the short term, but the fundamental problem remains.  It is a pity- this has the potential to be huge part of the cost-benefit calculation in favor of Amazon Prime. Instead, the benefit is essentially nullified, and one is let only with the (increased) cost."
"October 16, 2016","I really enjoy the music that has lyrics included. Now we wish every possible song in there would include the lyrics. Thanks!"
"September 22, 2015","I love Amazon and I love love Amazon prime music. I feel like there is actually another person on the other end who knows all the music I love and they just pick the best songs all day!!!it's crazy to find a Mac dre station. I also heard on the news recently that Amazon has spent around 100 million on letting their prime members stream music and movies add free and I just want to say thank you Amazon for being legit! I love this company and everything about it."
"September 8, 2015","This app is difficult to use and fails often. I have never used an app that made it this difficult to play music. It stops after every song so I have to go into the app and hit play whenever a song ends, there are weird noises sometimes when using this as app, and it isn't user friendly in any way. This app is garbage, it was coded by running thousands of rats over a computer keyboard. I would rather use a cheese grater to remove my toes then use this app any more."
"August 18, 2013","Well, when looking for an alternative to Google Play, I thought for sure that Amazon would have their head on straight and would allow you to choose where the downloaded music is stored so that the memory limited main phone storage, which cannot hold my music collection, would not be crunched. Unfortunately, Amazon has it WRONG as well. There is no setting to choose the download location, thus the poor ranking of this application."
"November 6, 2016","Today, i've updated the Windows Version of the Amazon Music Software to Rel. 5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400. Because the in software upgrade option didn't work (the update didn't finish / it took forever), I had to remove it manually via Control Center, downloaded the new version and installed it manually. After first start the login screen locked quite crappy, pictures missing, poor contrast, poor dialog layout. However, i've managed to login. In the new software within the thumbnail view, about 60% of the pictures are missing (hate that). If i click some artist and change back to the my music overview the software constantly changes from thumbnail view to list view (really hate that). If i click to prelisten a track in the shop, i'm always getting a message ""a problem has occured"" while everything seems to be working as expected, always have to close this error message before i can select the next track (very very annoying). In the programm settings, i've deselected Auto. Music Import several times now, but Auto Music Import from folder always reactivates itself automagically (why is this option there, if i'm not supposed to change it?). The whole new software feels very laggy in contrast to the old software, although i've got the fastest PC hardware money can buy these days. While i like the Prime service in general (especially free shipment and video) and while i like the prime music idea and having a backup copy of all my music tracks in amazon's cloud, this piece of crappy low budget software makes me reconsider my cloud music backup strategy. And it makes me hate amazon, at least for the next few days. The android app is not much better. I'm going to uninstall both and stick with Spotify and large Micro SD cards in my DAC and my phone. I hope the people at amazon start using their software themselves, try it out!!! Really hoping that amazon music software is going to be fixed soon. At least to a level that doesn't piss the user off, within the fist 10 minutes of use! Hate it, when service providers waste my time!"
"July 5, 2014","Disappointed is not even close. Amazon prime is cherry picking songs from previously downloaded albums and refusing to let me access this purchased music unless I pay more money!"
"December 1, 2016","Amazon needs to make some major improvements to their Amazon Music App on the Kindle Fire series. It does not work well offline (appears the buffer memory is way too small). Besides not working well offline, you have to actually tell the Kindle Fire device to work offline and then tell it again to work online... How stupid is that? Can't Amazon's own app on it's own name brand device figure out if it is connected to WiFi or not and function accordingly? I love the Amazon Music service concept, but the Amazon Music App currently is so sub-par. In addition, when the Amazon Music App crashes, you literally have to reboot by turning off the Fire and then turning it back on again. On both my Apple and other Android-based devices, in the rare instance that an app does crash, you can wait a few seconds and then just re-launch it. Not so with Amazon Music. To shame!  Also, it appears that the Amazon Music App has functionality issues with reading/writing music files on large memory cards. I have had Amazon Music crash and then my Fire HD 8 suddenly can't read my name-brand 64GB SDHC card after the Amazon Music App crashed. I've had this behavior happen many times... Then it takes a series of reboots to get it to properly read the memory card (and apps loaded on it which are all grayed out on the screen) again. And then the Fire HD 8 and all apps and media on the memory card will work just fine for days, usually as long as Amazon Music App doesn't crash out again!!! So that tells me it's not a bad memory card at all... Somethings wrong with Amazon's app / device.  Overall, the Fire HD 8 Tablet seems to be an excellent low-priced tablet, but the Amazon Music App and phantom memory card error issues are killing it for me. Amazon, you're better than this, right? Get your device and app teams to fix this or I'm moving to Spotify and likely never coming back!"
"February 24, 2016","Mediocre at best. The prime music stations are utterly lacking in descriptive information. You are forced to try one-- and if it's absolutely horrible to you? Too bad-- the stupid app thinks you *liked* it, even if you only listened to the first few seconds of each song, before clicking ""no"".. and after 3 or 5? You realize that station is not for you.  But. The app *now* thinks you LIKE that sort of crap-- and offers more of the same dreck! Horrible!  A simple description under each station is too much to ask? Or even just a category label? No? As if I'm supposed to recognize these people (after which the station is named... right)?  I'd love to learn about new artists-- but not at the risk of opening a station that absolutely sets my teeth on edge (i.e. ""cow hard country""... makes me ill).  Where is a FILTER for the prime stations? I don't care what is popular! I just wish to eliminate musical styles I find objectionable-- but there is no way to do this in this app.  One star, all but useless."
"May 24, 2013","This MP3 player is useless on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Android 4.04 phone. The app will only use the phone's internal memory to store all of its data. All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache, and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone (depending on other apps you have) before you will fill up an S3. Streaming is fine, but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small (these days) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap. Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally, but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon's MP3 cloud progam. So yeah, it's useless. Deleted app, canceling cloud subscription, will just use a competitor cloud product and rip CD's or whatever, if they can't make it convenient, then what good is it, really?"
"December 10, 2016","Several issues with this software/service. It does not work on Roku yet except to access my purchased music. Can't find other music or playlists. Then on my BLU Advance 5 phone (Android) from Amazon, the app hogs itself into the main memory of the phone and will not move to the added SD card. As a result (like other Amazon apps), they all take up so much memory in a limited memory phone that it makes it impossible to use.  Overall, on other platforms, I don't find it as versatile as Pandora in finding music, building playlists, or creating ""stations"" of my own. At this stage, I am staying on Pandora."
"November 16, 2014","I wanted this app to be good since I'm a prime member. I could get over the clunky gui, but the app won't play more then one song off a playlist or album. This used to work fine but as updates have come it's gotten worse and worse. First it would only play five or six songs off a playlist/album. Now after the most recent update it will only play one then stop. The app will also crash every time I try to play a downloaded song. Really buggy and poorly written program. I expect much better from Amazon."
"October 20, 2016","Can't even login into it both Google play and in Amazon underground 🙁"
"November 13, 2016","The app keeps closing for no reason. It used to be a great app and always opened automatically when connected to Sync. Now it won't stay open. I have to keep switching back to FM while driving because Amazon Music closed. Please fix this!"
"March 9, 2017","You buy music with this app, but you can't play it on any of your new devices. It's the worst. It doesn't let you play it because you have to deregister your old devices on Amazon.com from a web browser. But you have no way to register a new device. So Amazon Music will give an error called ""Ah fiddlesticks"" which means... awe, our music software can't play the music you paid for on your new smartphone.  Oh and then, it says that you have to buy a Kindle or something like that in order to register your new device. What kind of non-sense is that?  Asked a friend who tried Amazon Music once if it is even worth trying to register a device, and he said, ""Amazon Music has the worst possible audio software and makes your high quality mp3's sound very, very bad."""
"September 25, 2017","I have 2 major complaints about the Amazon Music Android app.  1. When playing music ""OFF-line"" (from tracks that have already been downloaded to my device), playback frequently pauses, as if it's having a buffering problem similar to a streaming (ON-line) connection. the interruptions to playback are incredibly annoying and don't happen on any other music player using the same device.  2. There is no way to auto-play music on bluetooth connect. When I start my car, I want my music to start playing as soon as BT connection is established. The Amazon Music app does not support this feature. I have tried using other apps (Bluetooth AutoStart and others) and can successfully LAUNCH the Amazon Music app on bluetooth connect, but I am not able to PLAY music unless I unlock the screen and select the music I want to play.... Well.. If I already have Amazon Music App running on the phone, it will transfer over to the car and keep playing, but, that's only if the Music app is already running.  For example... Black Player music app will auto-play on bluetooth connect from a cold start. Black Player doesn't need to be running. It just recognizes the BT connection and starts playing the song that was last played when it was turned off. This is the way a music app should work... of course you should have a setting to be able to turn off this feature if you don't want it...  If Black Player can do it... why can't Amazon?"
"September 13, 2014","Amazon Music with Prime Music for mobile devices is unusable. Have contacted Amazon customer support for over a week and a half to no avail. Amazon customer service reps try to help and are sympathetic, but the bottom line is the Amazon Music with Prime Music App for mobile android devices does not work.  On the ""Cloud"" setting music cuts in and out. Music downloaded to ""Device"" does not play at all. The only music the app plays without error are songs that have been purchased. It is strange that the music that has been paid for plays fine without cutting in and out, but the Prime Music in the ""Cloud"" and ""Device"" downloaded into the playlists do not.  Nice try Amazon, hopefully the kinks get worked out. Would like to see it play like the P.C. version."
"August 22, 2013","Let me start by saying, I have been using computers since I was 5, and by now with some ease. I am no stranger to downloading music, I've been doing so since the Napster days.  Without going into every single story, I have to say the Amazon system for accessing MP3's is by far the least intuitive, most poorly programmed system available. It's bizarre something from an otherwise wonderful, customer satisfaction oriented company is so poorly designed.  Purchasing is easy with Amazon. which is why I chose it over iTunes a few times. Each time, I remember how terrible the downloading system is, but I figure ""oh I was probably just not figuring things out, silly me!"". Wrong. It's genuinely terrible.  Just today, I purchased 20 or so songs, but in order to retrieve them (oh, and honey, this is after a call to Amazon and FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS) I was somehow forced to re-download everything I had in my Amazon history. So rather than 20 new songs, I now have 200+ duplicates plus my new songs. I feel violated by you Amazon. So does my hard drive space."
"April 19, 2016","This software is getting more unpredictable on my Galaxy S5 as time goes on. It will not allow me to put new purchases on my SD card on my phone. I don't like having to stream music while out on my runs because it uses up my data from Verison. When I do stream, it often changes to a different album on it's own. I also like using Power Amp because it works predictably and the sound is much better. Even the headset buttens in Amazon are unpredictable. I have not been able to upload the last album to my phone. Sometimes it will down 1 to 3 songs but will not download the entire album. Your music software has turned to the worst software I have ever used on my phone. Factory reset doesn't help. ."
"April 20, 2017","So I am an unlimited Amazon Music subscriber and some pros/cons:  Pros: 1. Huge quantity of music to select from 2. Family plan works for my whole family - thank you Amazon for finally making this available. 3. Integrated with Alexa  Cons: 1. Stations and playlists are not curated/updated. Unlike Pandora or many other music services, the stations and playlists on Amazon are pretty much the same. For instance - any time you start the Classical station, the first tune played is Yo Yo Ma - EVERY TIME.. Amazon really needs to step it up in the curation management of their stations. 2. Variety of playlists and stations suck. They have the generic genre stations and then they have stations by artist but there is no ability to select 3,4,5 artists and have the site dynamically create playlists/stations for you. I miss this feature the most from Pandora and find myself going back on occasion (with commercials) just to find different music that is similar to the music I already like. My kids use Spotify the majority of the time for this reason as well.  I'm sure Amazon will eventually catch up but with all their resources, they are very slow to add them."
"August 5, 2014","App will CONSTANTLY turn itself on and eats up LARGE amounts of data, sometimes entire GBs at a time if you don't pay attention. Since the update, I've yet to get an album to download without it failing, whether Im on wifi or 4G. Amazon employees are useless too, as all they say is to uninstall it and reinstall it, which does nothing.  I will no longer be purchasing music via Amazon for Android."
"June 27, 2014","Great job. Promote your new prime music and make the player incompatible with older hardware (2 year old phone and first generation Kindle). It has speakers, it has a audio jack, Pandora, Slacker, everything else works on it. Guess I will say screw it to Amazon Prime Music and stick with tried and true music players that don't give me a hassle.  Be warned, if you don't like spending several hundred dollars every year to upgrade your tech then you wont like this application because it wont like your perfectly good hardware. Way to be like Apple Amazon."
"August 20, 2017","This app is constantly having loading issues, I download every song to a playlist for work and yet when I turn off my internet it will get to a few songs it can't seem to play anymore even though they say downloaded right there on the list, what gives?  Not only that but just random songs will stop playing internet or not, and instead of skipping them the playlist will just sit loading endlessly, and it will be the same song every time for a week, then a different one, it's really annoying that I cant just open my music in another app on my phone this one is very often completely unusable."
"June 16, 2014","After installing this app on a Samsung Galaxy S3, my battery power significantly decreased so much that my phone couldn't even make it through the work day. I uninstalled, the app, and my battery usage returned to normal. So I installed a new battery in my phone and re-installed this app. Again, battery power took a nosedive. And again, I uninstalled it. I really would like to use this app, but it is doing something in the background that drains the battery."
"October 25, 2015","i enjoy the amazon music area that comes with my prime membership...it has such a wide selection and great mixes as well...i like to play around with this music area when cleaning the house and dancing with the kids...makes cleaning fun and i get my exercise at the same time...thanks so much fun...mom and family approved"
"May 26, 2016","I really want to love this app. I really do. Having legally free music is appealing and having good recommendations made has certainly increased the library of music I'm playing.  But this app is absolute garbage. It was designed by someone that never has used a music app before. Maybe it's my phone? I have some spare cell phones, I'll try this on to see if I experience the same issues and update my review.  For reference, I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (t-mobile variation) and I'll be testing it on my Nexus 5 (old model) and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus (T-mobile variation) and a Samsung Galaxy S3 if it powers up.  So here are the huge glaring issues with this app and service:  1) You can only upload 250 songs to the cloud. That's pitiful. Amazon is the damn king for cloud computing. I refuse to believe they can't easily and at low cost up that number. Google play music (which I was using before) let's you upload 50,000 songs. A 250 limit severely restricts us and I refuse to rebuy my music catalog from amazon mp3.  2) If you add more music to your playlists from your computer, and you hit download on your app instead of it just downloading the new tracks you added onto the same playlist (ie Favorites) it creates a new playlist (Favorites 01) it doesn't redownload everything, but it's a nuisance. In a year what will I be at? Favorites 69?  3) Why can't think app sync with the music app on my Amazon Fire Tv? With google play music I can connect to google play on my chromecast and play my music on my surround system, I want to do that on here as well so I don't have to constantly skip tracks I've already heard recently.  4) This is the by far the biggest frustrating issue for me.....and related to # 3. This app has never once played a playlist all the way through. And it is INFURIATING. What's the point of having a 800 song playlist if it keeps restarting!?! I listen to music on the way to work and I'll get to track 8 of 800 and when I drive home in the afternoon I should be able to resume on track 9 of 800. But it doesn't. It. Keeps. Restarting. So I spend most of time skipping tracks, because ""i just heard that this morning, heard that yesterday."" Google Play Music never once had this issue.  I want to hear a playlist all the way through. I want to get home, sync the app to amazon fire tv and listen to music as I wash dishes, then go to the gym and continue my playlist. And I want to not have the playlist keep starting over again every time I open the app.  I switched from Google Play Music because of the allure of all that free prime music, and it has introduced me to some really great stuff I'd never heard before. But the app is currently a broken mess."
"June 21, 2017","Is there a way to overactive stars? This coming from a long time Amazon devotee. But they have fallen far from good graces. Do not purchase music through Amazon music. They are worse than Apple with their proprietary management of what they sell. I had a presentation set up that incorporated music I had purchased through Amazon. Now I am left to buy the music for a different source because the Amazon music app is no long supported on my non Amazon devices. And mindless have become the worst devices on the market Bad move Amazon. Yes I have a voice Nd I will use it to warn others of your bad dealings"
"June 7, 2017","The app needs some improvement in order to make it more user friendly. It has a very generic setup. The biggest pain is getting your library move over from another service like Apple Music. It's not easy if you have playlist you want to keep in place without having to make new ones. Sorting is limited, very limited columns selections in your songs catagory (roughly 2 choices vs Apple Music has over 40 choices). It has a duplicate choice in advance settings, but there is no option(or a way) for the user to run a duplicate command like Apple Music. Preference tab is very limited as well. These things makes this service well behind Apple Music, but like any other service it can be improved. The one big advantage Amazon music has over Apple is price. Amazon does offer 2 months off for a full year subscriptions vs Apple which offers no discount which is why I decided to give Amazon a try."
"June 16, 2014","UPDATE: I now have the Galaxy S7. And guess what? This app is TERRIBLE. The ""update"" causes my playlists to stop after every song. It will not recognize my downloaded music library (4000 songs, and this app can't find ONE of them). And tech support is non-existent. I've reinstalled 3 times. I've uninstalled the update twice. I've refreshed about 10,000 times. Nothing helps. And I was stupid enough to upload my music to Amazon Cloud and build playlists from Prime Music. I think Mr. Bezos should refocus on his company rather than the Post or space junk."
"May 17, 2014","This app only does a few things, it's basically a music player with a built-in store. Being someone who uses Amazon Cloud Player, I expected this to work like a breeze but there are all kinds of problems.  The main one is that across both this app and the Cloud Player, Amazon have a pathological problem with track ordering and identifying albums which has STILL not been fixed. Talk about keeping the main thing, the main thing, I can't imagine how they can't fix it. Uploading tracks from iTunes to Cloud Player lose their track ordering because some of them get the year and disc number and some don't. Album artwork that is taken from a completely different album even though the tracks I've uploaded all have the correct tagging. I thought this was perhaps a Cloud Player issue but...  ...nope. This app seems to have the same problems. Take Presto, an album by Rush which I uploaded from iTunes. It broke like most albums did so I had to reset the tags in Cloud Player to make the track listings work and now they are correct. I recently bought a new phone and got this app, downloaded Presto from Cloud Player and....the app thinks it is two different albums so now if I want to play the whole album, I can't without creating a playlist. One of them is listed as Presto with the srtwork from Presto and has 3 songs on it and the other is also listed as Presto but with the artwork from Chronicles with the other 8 songs on it.  How on earth have Amazon mucked this up so badly? They are supposed to be kings of online sales and probably sell a large percentage of the online music market but this is basic cock up 101. The fact it has not been fixed? Fail The fact that this occurs on two products? Fail The fact that it happens on the app even when the tracks are supposedly downloaded from Cloud Player which is setup correctly? Fail The fact you can't even force the music on the app to go to the correct place? Fail The fact that the app thinks that Presto by Rush and Presto by Rush are two different albums? Fail.  Also, the tracks sometimes reset back to the beginning when playing.  The only reason I don't move to another service is that iTunes and Google Music don't sound much better. There is NOTHING actually keeping me with Amazon other than that."
"September 22, 2016","So buggy, i wouldn't use it if it didn't come with prime. I can't believe that amazon finds it acceptable. Music will often not load or the app will crash out mid session, if you make a playlist that has online and online music it can't play offline (just skip the online). I will download music and it still acts like it online music only. The app will turn on randomly and play music (happened once in a meeting which wasn't cool). In addition its painfully hard to exit the program on your phone, its like one of those bloatware apps that just wont go away once you opened it. It is easy to find free music or purchase music though and works on both iphones and androids. The iphone app seems to be less buggy then the android (no surprise)."
"October 26, 2014","It's cumbersome. It forces updates that don't automatically install on my system so I have to go in and download the entire thing again and install it in order for it to run properly (Windows 7 Ultimate). It doesn't allow me to choose where on my system I want to save the music, and it invaded my privacy before I could choose my preferences/settings by going through all the existing music files on my computer (most of which are NOT from Amazon) and making a playlist for me... While I like Amazon for a lot of other purchases, particularly Kindle books, I'm not buying music from Amazon anymore. Going back to iTunes."
"June 5, 2017","I've been using Amazon Music for a few years, and enjoyed downloading purchases to my android phone so I can play my own music in my car. Now, however, I can't get through a single song through the car without an error message (exception 180) that stops the player cold. The error messages suggest I ""try again,"" but the same thing happens over and over again to the point that I am completely UNABLE to play any of the music I've PAID FOR from my device. This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing. Now, I have to find a music player that doesn't hand up, and I figure, since Amazon music won't play on any other player, that I've tossed literally hundreds of dollars down the crapper. And, from what I'm seeing on these message boards, Amazon customer service hasn't even bothered to address this issue with the customers who present it. What a big FAT disappointment, Amazon."
"September 28, 2017","It delivers good sound but I have noticed that searching for stations from the app is much less user friendly than the webpage version. Also, every time you touch something, it starts playing and then gets added to your Recent list. I cannot remove the lullabies station from that list, which uselessly takes up precious real estate. The other thing that is making me debate uninstalling is that it keeps starting on its own. After I have shut it down, by pressing the X, it keeps starting itself up again. After 5 or 6 closes, it stays closed."
"March 1, 2015","Why Amazon can't get album covers right is beyond me. They use Gracenote. So does Apple where I rip the CD. Apple gets it right but when I upload to Amazon they can't get it right. I have spent hours on hours trying to correct album covers. Just gave up. There is an easy solution. Let me update the album cover on your website like Google Music does. What I have learned is that if you adjust music titles or album names, you might get the right cover to show. Also, having the right cover on the website does not mean that the right cover will show up on a Kindle Fire device. Or, it might be wrong on the website, but will be right on the Kindle Fire. Go figure. They have until my subscription expires to fix this. Too many other services that get it right to keep paying for this one. Apple gets it right. XBOX music gets it right. Google gets it right. When all three of these services don't, they let you fix it. Amazon does not, you are stuck with what they give you."
"June 23, 2017","Nope, now they're forcing you into a pay to play. With the app you can no longer just search for a song and BUY it. You have to sign up for their new program and get a free month until you start paying. Guess I'll just keep the older songs I purchased, and mix in Pandora."
"July 17, 2015","Prime membership makes this the perfect App for any mobile device, you can either download prime music to your device and for those who are worried about storage can always stream there music online and it's all included with the Prime membership. Lots of music to choose from and all free with your membership, if your song is not available free on prime you can always find deals on entire albums or just buy the songs you like while saving you more money in the long run. Automatically sorts out your music and you can add whatever it is to your digital library. This is very easy to use and would highly recommend using this if you are a Prime Member why pay for another music service when you have already paid for a Prime Membership make the most of Prime."
"November 27, 2016","Doesn't work with prime."
"March 11, 2014","Have on phone and tablet. Love I can play from device or cloud. Downloads very easy to SD card with help from mover app. I have play lists on each that work for the device I'm using. Love that purchases automatically added. I am very happy with a great tool.....app. One request ...please add back the ability to add more play lists to currently playing. Thank you. Update****** So unhappy, this had been a favorite app of almost all my apps, I now hate it with a purple passion. Please please fix this. I can no longer see what I have added or purchsed in my music loaded to my device. There for, I just purchased a song and it take for ever, FOREVER to add it to playlists. I use playlists all the time. I would go to the play list, and to the purchsed and add the new songs, no can do now., or go to the purchased and the new song and add it to the playlists Now I can only do it through songs, albums, etc. It takes forever and is no longer fun to do. Music must be easy and fun, it is not about work, but bringing joy, happiness, relief, healing etc to my life, NOT STRESS. Please Please make it fun and easy and stress free again, make it the best again, instead of the worst app I have. Thank you. I am so sad to have had to write this. Was 5 stars, now 1. Please let me put it back up to 5 stars."
"November 18, 2016","I used to love this app (when it was still an orange icon). The latest update ruined what was better than iTunes. I have this on my iPhone because I used to like it better than iTunes. It was much easier to navigate while driving. The latest update ruined that. It is now so complicated and counter-intuitive that I can't even really use it while I'm driving. Since I spend about 20-30 hours on the road every week, that's a problem.  This latest update didn't even fix what has been the biggest problem with the app since I have used it. It treats compilation albums as though each artist is a separate albums. So instead of one Christmas album with 14 songs, in the albums list, you have 14 albums, each one song in length because of the different artists. Ridiculous!  Other issues I have had since the update include losing individual songs from albums that were uploaded from CDs. Jumper from my Third Eye Blind album just vanished from the middle of the album. No other songs, just the one song. Go figure. What's worse, is that albums that I purchased from Amazon disappeared altogether. For example, I had purchased the full version of Maroon 5 (the Animals album) along with the lyrics book. Since there is a ""Prime"" version of this, all of a sudden, I had the prime version with no lyrics book. I was able to re-download the version I had purchased but it still sucked to discover that on a three hour drive and no time to pull over and figure out what the hell was going on. Because it was the prime version, it wasn't in my normal list of offline albums. So initially it looked like it vanished altogether.  The controls are my biggest issue with this new update. What used to be simple, straight forward controls are now ""fancied up"" to the point where they are almost as dangerous as texting to try to used while driving, especially trying to switch between albums. The menu defaults to settings instead of just sticking to my offline albums list.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!! I just clicked the app to double check what I am saying here and all of my albums are gone. Literally all of my music, except, oddly the one song that I have purchased from iTunes recently. THAT song is still there. Everything else is literally wiped out. I'm done. I'm going back to iTunes. Amazon, someone needs to be fired for overthinking, over-engineering and just throwing a bunch of bells and whistles at this app, instead of fixing the actual problems with it."
"August 23, 2017","I get the ""Prime"" version with my prime account for free otherwise I wouldn't use it. The app itself is pretty looking but the functionality is average and the music service itself is below average.  The real benefit of Amazon Prime Music is no commercials otherwise every other music app (Pandora, Slacker, etc.) is much better in every way.  The available music is limited and music stations in Amazon Prime Music are horrible. My guess is that it's because they want you to buy the unlimited music service or because they'd have to pay the artist and don't want to in a ""free"" service. Example: The other apps have a ""top pop station"" where all the latest and greatest is played and the selection is excellent. Amazon Prime Music - not even close. Amazon claims these stations / play lists are created by experts. I'd add say it differently....they're created by experts who are limited by the music available."
"December 16, 2015","I've used several different streaming music apps. Some tried forcing me to upgrade to get rid of ads and others won't force you but the ads are inserted in at ridiculous frequency! I downloaded this to try the no ads steaming with Prime.  I like it! It's really easy to use, I can create my playlist for work, working out, relaxing or whatever. I also like that I can search for an artist and add songs that way for through channels. Another cool thing is the xRay Lyrics that shows the song lyrics as the song is playing. Awesome!  The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to add artist to an existing channel - similar to Pandora. Other than that, I like this app, I can pause, skip and shuffle. It definitely helps my day pass faster when I can listen to music I like while I'm working."

"January 2, 2017","The entire reason I even bothered trying Amazon Music was because I thought it would offer a better user experience for seamlessly playing music with the Amazon Echo that my husband and I were gifted. My husband signed up for a 30-day Amazon Music trial to try it out with the intention of purchasing the $14.99/month family plan. Magically, 7 days into his trial, he was getting notifications saying his trial was up when attempting to play music. We had barely even had an opportunity to use it. Looked in the box that came with my Amazon Echo and found a 3-month credit for Amazon Music. Great! Applied it to my account and within a few minutes we were back to streaming music. Wasn't getting the best song or artist suggestions that I had seen with other services like Pandora and Spotify so I attempted to log in to Amazon Music on my laptop to organize playlists and was met with a screen offering a 30-day music trial AGAIN. Exhausted with the Echo streaming experience, tried Amazon Music on my Android device and even after verifying that I was signed-in on my account correctly, it acts like I don't have a 3 month credit so we weren't able to stream music while driving. Overall, pretty inconsistent user experience and much more trouble than it should have been to simply stream music. ""Credits"" don't seem to be true gift cards or credits so I would avoid that. Had in-laws in-town during the few days we had the trial and they said it made it seem like both Amazon Music and the Echo weren't worth their cost. Wouldn't recommend it to friends. Giving it 2 stars because it could at least play the majority of specific songs or artists that I requested but then again, other music services have had this figured out for years. I'll be sticking with Pandora."
"June 12, 2014","OK, so i downloaded/installed this app on my Android Samsung S3 and it seemed to work fine. Played music, had all my purchases there, etc. All was good until I wanted to exit the app to avoid it running in the background and thus run my battery down and who knows what else in this day of NSA spying.  I tried e-mailing customer service and got no help. I did call and did get to speak with a rep who informed me there is no exit button in quick fashion. Thanks, that answered my question. That is all I wanted.  The whole thing is that every other music app I have on the phone has an ""Exit"" button available in it's menu. Sky Fm? Sure. Winamp? Better believe it does. Free Radio? Sure does, though it can be a bit clunky at times. Heck, even Anime Radio has an ""Exit"" button that shuts down the app.  But this app? Nope!  That is a serious flaw. Caused me to get rid of the app. It took using the Unistall menu option rather than just dragging it to the trash can, but at least it is now gone.  And good riddance.  If they ever get their act together and put in an exit button, I'll reinstall it.  Perhaps Amazon just ought to stick to what they do very well, namely selling stuff and forget services.  This one sucks due to the one fatal flaw."
"August 11, 2015","This is one of my favorite benefits of Prime! No extra cost to stream music from all genres commercial free. I listen on my laptop, kindle, and phone with perfect back to back flow, no issues of any kind. There are so many free choices available, that my playlist is pretty much neverending! Great free choices, great service!"
"January 15, 2017","The last straw. I had switched from Spotify to Amazon music because Amazon had a few songs that Spotify doesn't and the music sounds a bit better from the Amazon app in my opinion. I am giving this app a one star rating for two reasons below and after submitting this review will be unsubscribing from Amazon music.  1) This app constantly restarts in the background and drains the battery on my phone. I have had to install a separate app just to put it into hibernation 2) A bug seems to have been introduced recently where despite there being 70 songs in my playlist, the app insists on repeating the same song endlessly. Selecting skip only returns to the songs beginning. The only way to get a new song is to manually select it. Not something I feel inclined to do- especially since I only used this app during workouts."
"December 25, 2015","I am revising my assessment in the light of developments. My original harsh assessment was an accurate reflection of my displeasure of the reproduction of the newly released Best 50 Beatles' Songs. Playing them back via an Amazon Fire TV module to a Sony TV the tracks were a mixture of passable although degraded with respect to CD quality, but in others the voice track was entirely missing or so weak that it was hardly audible against the instrument background. My original reflex was to blame the sound engineers for sloppy control. I would now like to retract this negative assessment as I have found the cause although I don't understand the detailed mechanism yet. So I am writing this just in case others come across something similar. Let me add this only occurred on these Beatles tracks so I was fixated that it was the new tracks that were at fault. Well it appears they were not. In the early morning of post Xmas I reexamined the audio settings of my TV. Not those with altering the frequency response but ones connected to the speaker system. On changing my system to a dual system set to stereo voila the full tracks were reproduced. How this change can affect the selection of tracks within an individual tune I fail to understand. However I submit these details so that anybody else that is having such problems might investigate their own possibilities. I have also revised my star rating accordingly."
"March 19, 2016","I don't understand how this app doesn't have all 5 star ratings. There is nothing it could possibly do better. I've stopped using Pandora altogether. Absolutely a must download for any Prime member.  UPDATE: After using this app for several months now, I am still in love with it. The navigation is pretty simple and doesn't require re-thinking all the time. Lyrics display if you want them to, which is a cool feature I've not seen anywhere else. Album art, great selection, the same stuff doesn't play over and over again, it's just great. Also, I haven't noticed an abundance of live albums which always bugged me on Pandora. I don't want to listen to live recordings, I want the studio release! If you love live music and hate studio stuff, I suppose that's an issue.  I continue to add to my library constantly and this is just the #1 music app in my opinion. I don't believe it has the ability to identify a song that is playing on the radio or anything like that, which is an improvement I would like to see. I currently use Google's widget for song identifying, then add it to my amazon library."
"July 31, 2015","I love this app! Being a prime member has so many benefits, I recommend to all my family and friends. I can set up different playlists easily. It is the most uncomplicated music app to use!! I get many free songs that are currently popular and they also have many older songs from all genres. The only thing I wish Amazon would add is a way for me to stream the music through my playstation 4!! Thanks so much Amazon!"
"December 19, 2016","UNBELIVEABLE! The Amazon Music App will not install on my 2015 Amazon Fire tablet or original Fire TV! When I try the Amazon product page says it's not compatible. Argh!  The product listing says it only requires Android 4.1 and both my Fire tablets and Fire TV have been updated to have OS versions based on Android 4.1 or newer. I'm blocked from even purchasing it (at $0 of course). Sometimes you don't even get what you pay for!  Maybe I shouldn't complain as the old app works fine for me. On the other hand a lot of good music seems to be disappearing from Prime music and I expect the added cost music subscription may be needed in the future to get good tunes. Just feeling a little dark at a good thing like prime being eaten away in parts I care about.  I hope Amazon isn't blocking all older devices from new apps. That would be bad. I'm giving this app only 1 star till this gets resolved, if ever."
"November 10, 2016","Updated 11/16/16 - I updated all of the drivers on my Dell laptop and now this app is working. I was having issues with my laptop waking up when I moved it to and from the docking station. Updating my drivers fixed that problem and appears to have fixed the issues with this app too. I also un/reinstalled it several times. Upon opening it for the first time this time, I didn't dismiss the banner for signing up for Amazon Music. I don't know if that is why it's working or if it truly is the driver update. I wanted to add this though in case it will help anyone else. :) ********************** I used to love this app. My work won't let us have iTunes and now that it's been updated, it barely works at all. It freezes then fast shuffles through my playlist without actually playing any of the music. I have uninstalled/reinstalled three times to no avail. Also, it's messing with other programs on my computer now. I thought maybe it was something that happened to my playlist but I can't play anything. Opening/closing doesn't help, creating a new playlist (if I can get it to work long enough) doesn't work. Streaming from Prime doesn't work. It's causing me to waste a lot more time at work than I really have but I can't work without my music! This is all stuff I've purchased too so it's not like I am trying to get something for free or streaming pirated music or anything like that. I buy all of my music from Amazon. This is soooooooooo disappointing. Help! Isn't anyone reading these reviews that can fix it?"
"April 15, 2016","This Amazon Music software is crap. It's as if they shoved it out the door without ever testing it. Just to address the playlist aspect (although there's plenty more that stinks). First I tried to import playlists from iTunes. It had the names of them OK and I checked all the boxes - but they never were imported into my library for Amazon Music. Not the songs in the playlists, not the names of the playlists themselves. Then I tried creating playlists in Amazon Music. I could create them OK - but when I tried to add songs by checking the boxes, it would do things like add ALL the songs not just the ones checked. Then scrolling down the alphabetical list I'd check a song or two to add to a playlist - and the screen would inexplicably refresh, erasing my checkmarks, and re-setting to the beginning of the alpha list.  Whoever they had developing this software, they should fire them. Whoever they had testing it, they should fire them. Oh, they should fire the designers, too. It's clunky and it doesn't work."
"May 23, 2017","I took some time to build multiple playlists. The software updated and POOF my playlists are gone! All that work down the tubes. No warning, just gone. So I go to create new playlists, but now the app REBOOTS MY PHONE after four or five songs play! I'm sure it is the fault of something else though, which explains the new player I downloaded played around 20 songs without missing a beat! Gee, I wonder where I should create my playlists? But Amazon Music does play music. It appears that the bulk of their programming efforts are in support of cloud access - I'm guessing, as I only stream music when on my wifi, and even then only occasionally. But that's okay Amazon, I found a new friend in music!"
"January 5, 2016","I paid to have amazon music for a year where I could click on a song and add it to my phone. I should have checked the list of songs available. I like Christian music and have a lot of music on my Ipod from ITunes. it doesn't appear to be transferable to my droid phone so now I have this. The list of bands available was far less than I expected and ended up buying a few albums already. Keith Green is a major artist, Amy Grant, Petra are a few not on the list except a song or two. Please add more artists if possible. Thank you."
"January 5, 2017","I want to rip the software from my computer and kill it - this is horrible, it freezes, it shuts off, it takes about 25 minutes to 45 minutes ON HIGH SPEED internet connection to download cd, that is if it doesn’t crash in the middle of the process. I DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! This is horrible. I am going to look for a different place to purchase music, I can no longer deal with trying to use this nasty, horrible, uncooperative, freezing, non-working software. Amazon you are forcing customers to use this instead of allowing them to choose how/where they want to download their music to/with. By forcing this nasty non-working software down the throats of your customers, you are losing customers. I refuse to purchase anymore music here. I can’t spend hours trying to resolve the problems with the nonworking downloads, the freezing, the crashing. It’s the end of my business purchasing music here, and I buy a LOT of music. I will also be canceling my subscriptions and other related services. It is hands down the worst software I have ever, ever, ever encountered. Again, Amazon, you should be TOTALLY ashamed of this product and what you are doing to customers. I have been with amazon for many, many years, I think since the beginning actually. Too bad... I am DONE!!!"
"June 17, 2014","Not that it will help, but maybe another 1 star will wake them up that there are still many original Kindle Fire users. How hard can it be to make this work on the original Fire when the Prime video streaming works just fine. I have a feeling this is just a ploy to get people to upgrade their device."
"October 23, 2015","Using Android app on Samsung S4  TL:DR - App not recommended and will not use in its current state even when service is free. Buggy, prescriptive and not user friendly. Pity as the service itself seems quite good.  Pros : Simple install/setup - picks up amazon account by itself from your device if you already have another amazon app Managed playlists are nice, good varied selection Lots of good music in there  Cons : Automatically scans your device and inserts any other music it finds into the app's music library  - no way to disable this  - no way to exclude or remove songs located elsewhere on your device (it simply adds them back in when it scans again)  - no way to filter library so it only shows music you downloaded through Prime Music - it mixes it with anything it found during the device scan No way to specify download location - defaults to using internal storage instead of external SD card, limiting downloads severely. Stutters fairly frequently during playback of downloaded tracks. No way to perform a multi-select of artists/albums/tracks within the library - have to perform actions on each one individually (adding to playlist/remove from library etc).  more settings needed in the poorly populated 'Settings' screen such as :  - specify download location  - specify which folder(s) to scan for exiting music  - disable device scan"
"July 18, 2017","I did not know this was a feature of Amazon Prime! Pleasantly surprised to discover this amazing option. I love classic country from the 60's through the 80's and there is a great selection available! One thing I find slightly annoying about Prime is that you pay a premium for the service. Then Amazon gives you what appears to be a partial service with an ""upgrade"" available for another few dollars a month in subscription services. Don't get me wrong, I'm satisfied with the Prime product, but the ""upsale"" attempts are annoying and make me feel as though I've been played by Amazon. Maybe it's just me, but this is not the way I would market the service."
"March 8, 2017","The music I listen to is usually a remake or some kind of remix crap that I can't stand. I also do not want to pay a dollar per song for my genre of music. Especially when i can get out my cds or download em free somewhere else."
"August 16, 2017","The iphone version of this app seems to have constant issues. When opening the app it takes upwards of a minute for it to load and you to be able to access/select music, this assumes that it does not simply crash on you - which happens around 50% of the time. Not sure if it is Amazon or the iphone, but it is extremely annoying and difficult to use.  If you allow your screen to turn off, it is another minute plus of fighting with it to get it to work.  When it does work it is excellent."
"February 24, 2017","I am very disappointmented in Prime Music and Amazon's new ""music unlimited"". One of the reasons we have kept our Prime membership was because of the music. This is a crappy way to treat customers and keep trying to find new ways to get more money out of them. I notice there are several of the song in My Music that are no longer available to me and they have designated a lot of the more popular stuff to the ""music unlimited"". Amazon should have at least allowed existing Prime members access to the same service they had prior to making the change. We will most likely be cancelling our Prime membership."
"March 24, 2014","This is a pretty good app...  But I hate the fact that there is no way to exit the application without signing out of all Amazon apps completely.  This is frustrating.  I don't want this app constantly running in the background, but I don't want to sign in every time I want to use it.  So the only way I've figured out to exit this application is to go into Android ""Settings/Apps"" and ""Force stop"" the application.  Very annoying. Poor design.  If anyone knows a better way to exit the application, please let me know."
"December 10, 2013","This was a great app until this latest update. Amongst the improvemnts listed are that it's now supposed to be ""lightening fast""........erm no it's not. I've got my entire mp3 collection stored with Amazon and am now virtually unable to access it. It take minutes to load up album tracks after I click on the album ( if they appear at all ). This is happening on both my Galaxy s2 and my galaxy tablet. Ok they're not the most up to date hardware wise, but then again they are both more than capable of streaming music across a very fast internet connection. Please sort it out soon. In the meantime where can I download the old version of Amazon mp3, as this really is completely hopeless now."
"July 28, 2017","Use to be a great application but in last few months after last few updates / redesigns has tuned into total garbage and never works correctly. reinstalling one last time and if issues presist I will be moving to another platform."
"March 19, 2017","Amazon Music Suck's. Amazon Corp. Lied To Me. Amazon Told Me Since I Was A Paid Member Of Amazon Prime Video That They Would Give Me Amazon Music For Free & That Was A Big Lie From Amazon Corp. Amazon Corp. Doesn't Know How To Tell The Truth. Amazon Corp. Lied To Me. Amazon Corp. Customer Service Act's Like Joker's & Clown's. Please Amazon Corp. Stop Lying To Customer's Telling Them That You Will Give Them Free Amazon Music & You Give Us No Free Amazon Music Like You Promised Me."
"June 29, 2014","I want to start with this: my dad has nominally enjoyed the use of his Kindle Fire. But I am continuously stunned by how Amazon continues to pour cold water on the already sputtering flames in their app store. So many apps sit years without any possibility of a new update in sight. Sure, those 3rd parties aren't pummeling me for data on every aspect of my life... But that's probably because Amazon doesn't want to share.  Regardless of that fact, I cannot fathom why, on the heels of their announcement regarding their new Fire Phone plus all of the rest of their attempts to draw consumers into their ecosystem, they would not have a proper update for their Kindle Fire customers. Not only does their weak app store show how they're catering only for the elderly-monied-suburban-dumb-phone-devotees, it also demonstrates how once they have those dollars they will make zero effort to be a useful platform."
"August 2, 2014","I'd been satisfied using the old Amazon MP3 app for some time on my Galaxy S3 and was recently steered into this new ""upgrade"". I don't have Prime so I'm not at all interested in the new Prime features. In practice, I like to download my Amazon MP3 purchases to my phone's micro-SD card so I can play them anywhere without needing to use a network though this has always been a bit more involved than necessary since the old and new app have no option for selecting a different download storage device than my phone's ever shrinking built-in memory.  I have to say the latest version - Amazon Music with Prime Music V4.0.4 - is quite disappointing. When I open the app to download new songs, it immediately displays a message that it is loading cloud songs before I even do anything. It is not clear why the app needs to load cloud songs or why this is taking so long because I have automatic downloads turned off in the app. Whatever the app is doing, it appears to slow the responsiveness dramatically. I then open my Amazon MP3 Library Recently Added list and tap the download icon. It can take a good 10 seconds or more before the app responds and begins downloading. Downloading appears to be much slower than in the old (non-Prime) version over WiFi. And downloading is extremely unreliable -- about one third of my new MP3 fail to download for an unspecified reason. After the list download ends, the app displays a red X next to the Recently Added list which can be pressed to retry downloading. This NEVER seems to work so I often have to scroll through the list of new songs manually, find each failed download and retry each song individually. This works for some songs but, for others, I have to cancel the download and then start a new download for it. During all of this, the app is excessively slow so it takes a while to determine if the app is going to actually retry downloading any particular song. And sometimes the slow response causes the app to switch modes and PLAY the song instead of popping up the retry menu for the song. There's no way to select a group of songs and then retry downloading, each song must be retried individually. After I eventually get all my songs downloaded to the phone, then I have to manually move them to the micro-SD card. Suffice it to say that this entire process is slow, painful and extremely frustrating. It is actually would be much easier and faster to remove the micro-SD from my phone and use my laptop to download my new Amazon MP3s directly to it. The only bright point in all this is that the app now seems to know which songs its already downloaded to my phone (the old version of the app would download songs and albums again and again and rename the files each time so it wasn't easy weed out the duplicates).  Frankly, buying MP3s from Amazon and getting them on my phone has become much too time consuming and frustrating.  UPDATE: Even worse than before. I'm lucky if I can get ONE purchased song to download to my phone Download Failed. Error: 1000 THIS APP IS COMPLETELY BROKEN"
"October 8, 2016","I've used the music app for years, mostly the iOS version and a few months ago started using the Fire Tv/Stick version and thought it was all right. The version just released recently is absolutely horrible however. No longer can you click on a song and select ""artist"" or ""album."" You just have the option to play it. A quick way of playing an album I recently purchased or uploaded was to just find it in the ""recently added"" playlist. Now you can just click on an individual song and listen to the entire playlist. What is really egregious though is when you go to ""my music"" you can get to your songs, artists or albums and they are in alphabetical order as before but what is missing is the alphabet menu shortcut we had before where we could jump to an artist like Joyce Manor for example, just by quickly scrolling to the J. Now you have to scroll through each individual artist name by name which if you have a large library can take quite a while. I feel like I'm being pushed by Amazon into relying on playlists and using the music app as if it was Pandora or something. I prefer my own library and that's what I want to play but this app makes that more challenging."
"November 30, 2016","I love this app. Well, I LOVED this app. After one update, and then another, it's less and less helpful. All the music I own is through Amazon, plus I'm a PRIME member, so I should be able to play all the PRIME music for free. But it's not working out. Music I've bought and paid for is downloaded onto my phone and then immediately deleted without my permission. PRIME music won't play. And other songs that I've deleted from my phone keep re-downloading - again, without my permission. And other songs that do play when tap on them individually, won't play in a playlist. It's very frustrating. I've deleted and re-downloaded this app several times, but nothing helps. And every update makes things worse. I just want the original app back so I can buy and play my music!"
"October 2, 2017","Doesn't work properly with Android Auto. Your own playlists are unavailable, unless you want auto-generated playlist of what Amazon thinks you want to hear. Cannot use voice commands properly, either. Most times, if it responds at all, it gives you something wildly different from what you asked for. This is basic functionality and has apparently been broken for some time or has never worked. I know Amazon and Google don't play nice with each other, but removing basic functions from their service is ridiculous. If I'm paying for a music service, I should be able to listen to it wherever and however I like."
"September 2, 2014","It's a good app that plays music even if not purchased from Amazon. However, I took off 2 stars because of a single (and annoying) bug. With Prime music, one can select certain tracks to download and play on this app. However, the app tries to play songs from albums where I've downloaded other songs. For example, if I download ""My Life"" from Billy Joel's Greatest Hits, it will try to play ""Only the Good Die Young"" even if I haven't downloaded it. This causes the music to stop and I have to correct it. Sometimes, I even have to go back and start the shuffle again. Yes, it's on music from the device only so that's not the issue. I hope they fix this soon."
"March 3, 2017","I love the Amazon Android Music app. I like to listen to music when exercising, walking my dog, taking a bath, mowing my lawn and the list just goes on and on.  I added my favorite songs and created my playlists using the web interface and my laptop computer. I then use my cell phone to listen to the music. I downloaded all the songs to my phone, so I can listen to them without using up too much of my bandwidth. So far, in the past 2 years everything has worked for me and so the saying goes - I hear music..."
"May 12, 2017","Yeah they are asking for more money, but suddenly, I could find all the music I love on this app. I no longer have to go to YouTube and listen to less quality music while keeping my phone open so YouTube works. Every song I want is in this. The annual fee isn't bad at all for not having to worry about paying every month, or not finding your song, or listening to ads. It's really a small price. Plus, I didn't find that they removed songs or at least that many songs from their prime anyway. I honestly don't know what people are so irate about. After all, you get what you pay for. You don't think $99 per year would get you free 2 day shipping, free choices of movies and videos, and unlimited music? Come on people!"
"December 31, 2016","Problems : 1) Too many Amazon variations of music packages. I'm at a point don't even know which package I have that Alexa booked for me?? 2) For the first time of my life my Amazon Music on my iphone 7 won't play nor recognized by my 2016 Honda Civic two door Coup? I went around the world to get support and back, no luck. The answer I received is even more confused than EVER!?!? 3) I wonder if Apple is interfering with Amazon? 4) I was a very happy customer until Amazon finally done something out of ordinary?? 5) I spoke to two different Amazon music tech support and received two different answers on New Year's Day, why Amazon??"
"November 1, 2017","1. If your previously owned music is on an external SD card and you add the same music to Amazon Prime music cloud it will see your previously owned music as ""downloaded from Amazon"" yet expired thus unable to play it. Moving music to internal memory solved problem. Customer support was no use. 2. Doesn't recognize .nomedia files = Audiobooks and everything else is now part of my music collection. 3. Locked in playlists! Doesn't use Android's internal playlist database, can't import/export playlists = lock-in to app, waste of my time, total horse s.... 4. User interface is poorly thought out IMO. For such a big company with such a big music footprint I'm shocked at how bad this app is. Seems the bigger the company the worse the app! Sad cause I really like Amazon Prime but their apps are terrible!"
"December 20, 2015","Until now, have been buying all of my digital music on Amazon and downloading it to my computers from the cloud player or from my shopping cart. Now I've got a new laptop, and I can't get an Amazon Music App for it without Prime Music being included. I have no need for streaming music, and I don't want the complication of an additional interface requiring me to take the extra step of rejecting ""listen free with Prime Music"" every time I want to buy a song. I want to pay for the songs and not be stuck subscribing to Prime forever.  There are so many little glitches in the Amazon Music app already, (most recently, I bought 4 songs in one day and tried to download them all to one computer, but I got a message that I had to authorize my device before downloading songs 3 & 4 after the first 2 had downloaded to that same device) I don't want the additional frustration of having to manually prevent Prime from intervening in every attempted purchase.  My solution - don't renew my Amazon Prime membership (so I don't qualify for free Prime Music services) or don't buy any digital music on Amazon."
"July 24, 2014","I love this app. I have registered both iPhones with Amazon and with each prime album I have purchased for free I've been able to down load to iPhones,and both of my kindle fires. My album collection stored in my cloud really got a whole lot bigger. Thanks to Amazon prime ."
"October 17, 2016","First, to clarify, I am not new to streaming audio and have them all from Pandora to Tidal. There are pros and cons to each and everyone's preferences are different. For me, I like to pick a Genre or Style and have the app do the rest (Pandora). On the other hand, I like to reminisce and find specific Artist (Pandora,Spotify,Tidal.)That being said, I don't like to have certain Genres shoved in my face everytime I open the app (You Know who you Are.) Then, there is Sound Quality and WiFi vs Cellular ( Tidal and Spotify) for SQ and (Pandora and Spotify) for Cellular.  Then there is the Skip limit thing which drives me nuts, you have to have Teen age girls to understand this one.  Anyway, the New Amazon Ultimate Music is by far the Best Streaming Audio on the market today, SQ, Stations, Playlist etc...  P.S I have cancelled Tidal and Pandora, my kids still prefer Spotify but when the Amazon Family option becomes available ( Late 2016) I will cancel them as well.  Hope this review is helpful, Thanks"
"July 28, 2016","Feels like a wedding DJ while listening. Every now and then you get a good song or the right version. Other times you get the cover band for your favorite songs."
"June 17, 2014","Shame on Amazon for touting this great, new ""perk"" for being a prime member and not giving full access to it. I was really excited when I got the email from Amazon about this feature and was VERY disappointed to find it won't work on my Kindle Fire or my Android phone."
"April 15, 2017","It's all right to have on in the background, no different than Spotify, except for one thing. Some of the songs don't sound right. Has anyone else noticed this? Hubs and I were both on our electronic devices with the Heavy Metal playlist going, and a Poison song came on and both of us thought it sounded just a little bit...off. Then this morning as we tidied the house with the 80s station on, ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" by Def Leppard came on. Only it was definitely NOT Def Leppard. I was/am big Lepps fan (today they're more of a guilty pleasure, ha ha ha) and I know the album Hysteria backwards and forwards. The song I was listening to may have been written by Def Leppard, but this version was definitely not performed by Def Leppard. The vocal harmonies were too slow, and completely unbalanced, where they used to be tight and perfect, no one voice could be heard over the others. Amazon seems to be too cheap to pay for the license to the actual album??? Kinda disappointed to be duped."
"February 5, 2017","This app keeps in idling when I want to listen to the music. It won't play. I'm sure someone out there is having the same problem. Called Amazon to notify the problem, but blew me off. I'm a half prime member paying for a full prime membership. Not good. Call me Amazon."
"August 25, 2017","This used to be on my kindle fire, making it easy to access my music and favorite stations. Now it is gone and I'm unable to use. Making my paid subscription seem worthless! Why would you make it so difficult to access a service you provide on your own devices?"
"August 16, 2017","I don't like that the music I download no longer goes to my own music library, nor do I like the fact that a lot of music choices I paid to download (even as a prime member) aren't available to me unless I become an Amazon Music Subscriber. I do like that it gives you the opportunity to listen to and download music that I wouldn't normally listen to or search for. I think as a Prime Member the subscription price should be lower than what it is. After the 30 trial I'll make a decision to keep or stop, at this point I'm not sure if it's worth it."
"April 22, 2015","Amazon Music, not quite ready for ""prime""time, and if I had to pay for the service, I'd request my money back.  Heres why I say this. First, create your own playlist. It's kinda good, the prime catalog is lacking, and I have yet to discover the magic bean that will allow me to add my local music on my PC to playlists on my phone (same account) that I can achieve VIA google music. Add to that I added 500 songs to my prime playlist.. It repeats the same 20 songs, I don't even hear some artists I've added.  Then came the ""stations"" these in theory are great, Pandora killer I thought.. But holy crap are the stations HORRIBLE. lets try punk rock. I hear the same 13-18 songs repeated. Half of which aren't really in the genre. Lets switch to the stations titled ""Van Halen"" One van halen song, then you'd expect a high energy classic rock song, nope.. Lets toss on something a lot slower by abba, stevie knicks or Fleetwood mac. Yeah, they're in the same class.  Long song? No problem.. We'll cut it off before it ends...  Add to that the app likes to stop playing, then start again, then stop again.. When writing this review I turned on the van halen station, connected to 4G, it would play one song and stop. Connected to work wifi, still played one song and stopped. Finally rebooted my phone, Plays one song and stops.. Not the best app in the pool at this time. Absolutely doesn't enhance my prime membership yet. Keep trying amazon.."
"November 6, 2017","This has worked great for us to date. We made a play list for our wedding with this app (I am a Prime member). It's nice being able to take our favorite music with us and being able to save it to an SD card when no internet is available. Only precaution-- you can not change the order of songs on your playlist once you have created it. The first song you save becomes the last one to play and the last one you save the first one that plays. I wish Amazon would add the ability to rearrange the order of the songs on any playlist you create / save"
"January 15, 2017","I use the Amazon Music app to manage all of the music that I download from the Amazon music store. I do this without ever subscribing to Amazon’s music “service,” which is something I have tried and don't particularly like. (All of my digital music from Amazon is either Prime or purchased.)  I have installed Amazon Music on all my Android devices except for, ironically, my Kindle Fire HD7 – which has all of the Amazon Music features already “baked” in to its software. I find the Amazon Music app very useful for my purposes, especially now that its interface has been redesigned. I can sort my downloaded music almost any way I wish – by genre, song, album, artist, whether it’s Prime music or music I’ve purchased.  I also have Amazon Music for PC, so whenever I purchase an album or song, it automatically downloads to whatever device I happen to use to make my purchase. Amazon Music for PC will synchronize itself with my Android devices, so I can very quickly see my new music on my smartphone and tablets almost as quickly as it appears on my laptop.  Amazon Music also serves as a music player on my devices. It does a very good job of sound reproduction, although it’s perhaps not quite in the same league with some other of the more full-featured (and expensive) music players.  I am very pleased with the Amazon Music app. It serves my purposes well, even though I don’t subscribe to Amazon’s music “service.” Highly recommended."
"January 23, 2017","The best of music to your liking. Always has what you're looking for and always delivers great pleasure to hear what you choose to listen too. Because I have Prime, I get to pick so many songs without having to buy it, so my choices are endless. This was a genius development of great minds that got together to create something all and everyone could enjoy. It must have taken more than one mind, but if it was one man, wow!"
"December 6, 2014","Let me choose where the app caches music. I was getting Disk Full errors on my phone when I realized it's been storing the music I play in a cache on my INTERNAL STORAGE. When I looked to see if I could change the location, that option didn't exist.  I had to plug the phone into a Windows machine and use Explorer to clear out the cached music. 1.8GB of cached files! Amazon, you can do better than that. Give us the option to set the cache location or give up on the cloud streaming business because this WILL NOT WORK."
"February 28, 2015","This does not meet my expectations. I expect an app like this to allow me to organize my music and it does not. In some cases I have to scroll thru all my albums one-by-one to find what I'm looking for. Now if I want to pull up albums by genre I 'm out of luck. It appears that in many cases Amazon randomly selects a genre that is not ever close. If I want to listen to classic rock I can pull up by artist which is in reality the performer. If I want to listen to classical I am again out of luck. This app does not let you pull up by composer. Clearly Amazon does not want classical listeners using this app. I can try a search but that only helps if the composer's name is in the title. I have tried creating playlists, not to listen to but to categorize my albums. Once I pull up the playlist and decide what I want to listen to. I then go look up the name of the album and pull it that way.  This is all such a shame because my Kindle for PC allows me to create all the categories I want and to beautifully organize all my books. Why can't this app? Who was the programmer on this? Clearly they were one of the few programmers on this planet that doesn't have a musical background. Another solution would be to use one of the external music apps like Tag Scanner which is the ultimate in organizing your music and plays it too. However all those prime albums you listen to, you would have to go buy so you can download them to your PC so an external app could play them.  Amazon could easily reduce their customer's frustration by allowing us to categorize our albums like we can our Kindle books. The code wouldn't be that difficult. Just hi-jack some of the code from Kindle for PC and perform a little neurosurgery on Amazon Music.and you're good. My dogs are unemployed and they are pretty good coders. They'd be willing."
"July 17, 2015","I wanted to chime in on Amazon Prime Music. I have been using this service for about a year and a half now. I absolutely love the easy access to my music collection whether I am on the internet at work, out in the world with my phone, chilling with my tablet, or enjoying music through the home surround sound Prime Music is ready to go and streams well!  However! I am a serious music collector and I adore having my collection labeled correctly, correct album art, and organised by year of release. Not too much to ask, these are STANDARD music program features since the first Windows Media Player and iTunes....  Well you can not change your album art in Amazon Prime Music! In the year 2015 and after years of complaints in the forums you still cannot do this. Yes, there are bogus work arounds like finding the artwork cache on your PC and pasting new arrowroot in there with the same file name as the bad artwork. However this only affects your PC amazon music player, it does not change on your tablet, phone, website etc. Then there is the method of downloading your album back to your PC, adding it to a better music player, using that music players artwork change feature, and then import it back to Amazon Prime Music which may or may not take it or just paste the wrong artwork on it again! Either way this is ridiculous and for a serious music collection this will take YEARS to correct my collection to my standards. So yeah, this is a MAJOR issue for me that really bugs me. Albums will have the wrong artwork, sometimes 3 albums in a row have the same wrong artwork, and many just don't have artwork at all.  You also are very limited in how you can view your music, no option for sorting or display release years which is another big issue for me. The program also displays your music very literally by artist instead of album artist. What does this mean? Well instead of displaying lets say all of Beyonce's music under one artist heading of Beyonce, Amazon will have 30+ Beyonce artists, one for every Feat she has ever done. The only way to condense this is to change the artist to Beyonce and lose the information on who she is singing with. This is soooooo frustrating!!  When it really comes down to it if i had a better option i would absolutely ditch Prime Music because it is just far too simplistic and limited for my tastes but when you already have a Prime account the price is just too sweet to ignore along with Amazon's fantastic storage limit and bonus features etc. and like i said before, having all your music everywhere and anywhere is pretty awesome! Overall i do like the service but there are just unacceptable issues that frustrate on a daily basis and after over 3 years of this program existing im just left scratching my head at how a giant like Amazon does not fix these issues.... I want to love it Amazon! And it is so easy to fix it so just do it already! I will only hang on so much longer that's for sure!"
"April 16, 2017","I've been a Prime member off and on over the years but I have issues with having to purchase a membership to be able to have access to the streaming video services and music. There is nothing special about Amazon music unlimited that would make me want to pay an additional $7.99 fee to get what used to be included with Prime at no additional charge. As far as the music app, it works okay although the player could be improved by adding a volume control. I briefly switched from Apple Music and my catalog transferred flawlessly but I maxed out my Cloud storage the first day and can't add anything else without paying an additional $25 a year, another Amazon gotcha. They are fooling people into thinking they are getting services for free but they are fleecing your pocketbook. Apple Music is not perfect but it has a lot of features I enjoy and the price you are charged is up front with no tricks or gimmicks. With Amazon Unlimited Music, that Prime membership becomes expensive. So, I give 3 stars for the app and 0 stars for the Amazon pricing structure."
"September 26, 2017","Checking it out. Old Redneck here, looking for more old Classic country. Not DJ dribble and overplayed popular hits. ... but ""CLASSIC"", by every definition,  Belly rubbin', Belt buckle shinin' dancing with your Woman, cryin in yer beer tunes."
"November 1, 2016","I'm seriously considering cancelling a long term Prime membership based on just how much this piece of software sucks. It's buggy, it crashes, it won't let you pick which folder to upload/download music to properly, it's a resource hog, it just basically is trying very hard to not let you use the space (which I pay them quite well for) allowed for my own uploaded songs. Absolute garbage. The music importer worked quite nicely, then the previous iteration of this piece of muck started out ok and you could choose your file locations quite easily. This is just trying so-very-hard to be spotify that it's losing sight of what made it BETTER than spotify. Any searches take 10's of seconds to display anything and then when you click on anything it takes an age to open up, if it bothers at all. This is running on an absolute beast of a PC so the issue is not hardware. Currently this piece of software = WOEFUL."
"September 1, 2017","With my Amazon Prime account, this is my go to audio app. Plenty of ad free music and the ability to store them locally when in areas without service. The only down side is that they tease you with Unlimited for an extra fee on some of the best songs when you search for them and the stations start to repeat songs fairly quickly."
"April 13, 2016","As a Prime member this is a nice way to get music since you have access to hundreds of artists and genre of music. But the app is designed piss poor and is not user friendly at all.  First, the interface is PAINFUL to use. Not only does the app NEVER keeps your music last listened to in check, there is no real way to make a Playlist, keep recently played music in check or even find what you last listened to. Sometimes the app saves it but half the time I am looking for what I last listened to which is annoying!  Secondly, the UI is confusing. It list cloud, Prime music, library and store but it never really has the list right for what you were listening to or want to listen to. It is just really a pain to find music I want to hear, even my own music!  Thirdly, how do you make a Playlist? I still haven't figured that out. The app is so painful to use I really haven't bothered.  If you just want to listen to music it OK for that. The app itself is a mediocre music player."
"July 21, 2017","Works very well. Most songs are very high quality and the ones that aren't are sometimes unusual or hard to find live recordings that may not have been released on a large scale.  I really, really enjoy this music service. (and Jenny)  Now all I have to do is decide whether to spend the extra money for the unlimited version!"
"November 11, 2016","after several years with this app and no problems something changed and all I have is problems of which the worst is that I can no longer play the music I own and downloaded on my computer."
"January 4, 2017","I tried to get this app to run on my Lenovo Tab and installed it multiple times and all it does is crash. To bad as I wanted to use it with my Prime account. But can't get it to work. Guess I'll use Google play instead. But that means I need to download my songs to my SD card."
"February 10, 2017","When on wifi or data, it will stream your music from the cloud rather than using your devices copy of it. Why on earth would they do that?"
"June 11, 2016","I'm really glad I can download my music just about to every device in the house, thanks to the app. It works on iPhone (5, at least), google's horrid, cruddy phone from Hhhheck, and the fun Windows phone, older versions of the Kindle, o'course. If we had Prime, we'd have access to just a ton of music our family loves! Hmm, maybe we'll do that."
"May 3, 2017","I have been an Amazon Prime customer for quite some time now. When I open up the Amazon Music app, it uses anywhere from 40% to 100% of my resources and will lock up my Virtual DJ program and sometimes my entire laptop. This is on a laptop with an i5 processor, 16GB ram and a solid state hard drive and that is all I use it for. I don't have any other programs installed on it. There is absolutely no reason why this program should kill a laptop in order to play or download a song. I have also noticed that not every song you purchase and download from Amazon is set up to be downloaded through the Amazon Music app, some are still coming down as a zip file. There needs to be a standard for downloads and then stick with it. I will stick with Amazon for a little while longer and if it doesn't improve, I am done with it. There are too many other options to buy or listen to music out there. Come on Amazon, you are far better than this."
"July 26, 2016","Music selection is pretty good, features are very basic (or well hidden), but there is one issue that drops it from a 4 star app to a 2 star app (on my Android). When I am done listening to it, there is no way to shut it off without either logging out (so than I have to login the next time rather than just opening the app) or force quit it through application manager. Also, if it is not on and my phone connects to my car's bluetooth, the music just randomly starts playing."
"July 20, 2016","I have used this app to pick and play music for years now and with this new up date I can't unless I allow access to my photos, media and storage. What the hell do they need to access my photos for much less my personal media for. So now I can't play any of my music that I paid for or access to free to prime members"
"November 13, 2014","I was excited when I saw that you had a way to stream music and such. The promise of FREE Downloads and listening for Amazon Prime members was even more exciting. Until I actually saw that ONLY SPECIFIC MUSIC was free. This reminds me of ALL the other lies told when advertising something free: For your FREE credit report, you MUST enter your credit card number... :-/ REALLY??  But overall it's better than what I had so that's why I say it's Okay."
"January 5, 2017","Horribly buggy. I installed it on Mac & PC & iPhone. Uploaded an album from my Mac. Looked like it worked great, but: on the PC, every track in the album is listed 3 times, and the album doesn't appear at all on the iPhone app.  This is bush-league crap written by amateurs. Don't waste your time.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if there was a cross-platform, cloud-based media solution that actually worked? So far, it doesn't exist, because the greedy bozos at Apple and Amazon are just not up to the task."
"July 1, 2014","Most disappointed that Fire TV has no Amazon Music with Prime Music app yet. Also disappointed in this app on Android, it stalls A LOT and requires an app restart or reboot with reload. Streaming is MUCH better on the TuneIn Radio app on FireTV-Android-iOS from many different online radio stations all over the world. I tried Amazon Music with Prime Music also on Windows 7 and Mac OSX and found it to be inconsistent or get error messages even after installing the latest version of Adobe.  On the other hand, Amazon Music with Prime Music seems to work fine on iOS on an iPod.  Amazon adding their Amazon Music with Prime Music enticed me to finally get a Prime Membership of my own rather than use a family member's. However, while the Prime Video is awesome with lot of choice and solid streaming as are all of the Prime Video apps, I am rather disappointed in the Amazon Music poor streaming/buffering problems."
"January 7, 2017","I gave the app one star, BECAUSE ZERO IS NOT AN OPTION! Completely ruined a decent app with this upgrade. I cannot upload anything from my laptop now. This app is now just a front end to sell you Amazon's streaming music service or single songs from their store. I don't buy single songs, I buy ALBUMS (and by the way, I have been buying 90%+ of my music from Amazon. This may change very soon!) On top of that, I pay $25 a year for the privilege of not being able to upload my music!  Does anybody know how to start a class action lawsuit?"
"January 24, 2016","Had my hard drive die on my pc. Installed new drive, downloaded Amazon Music to get my cloud music.......... Nothing is there !! So I copied a few of my discs to the hard drive and uploaded them. All the tracks said duplicate. Yet still not in the cloud. Even more frustrating they all show up on cell phone app. Even more frustrating than that, cant download from cell phone. Amazon all I can say is grrrrrrrrr."
"June 15, 2016","I purchased Prime so I could have the music option (music + free shipping was worth it to me, same or a little less than paying the $9.99 for rhapsody). Prime does not seem to have the newer albums (Rihanna, Blake Shelton just as two examples). Prime also does not have a very good variety of music to choose from (less popular artists that I CAN find on spotify). I was able to make playlists which was nice but when I play the playlists it stops after every couple of songs (receiving notifications does not make a difference in the playlist, it just stops playing randomly) but then other times it plays all the way through...I would say this is the biggest frustration. Also, it is slow at downloading. When I had rhapsody it was lightening fast, almost so much so I would lose track of where I was! If you download a few different songs at at time it takes a while to do and you can't search for other songs in the meantime. If Amazon doesn't fix these features I may consider cancelling when my year is up and going with another music app."
"October 1, 2015","Crashes a LOT! App is slow, search is sluggish and inconsistent. I can search for an artist and it will return suggestions but no albums by that artist, but when searching for a similar artist the first shows up as a suggestion?! Sometimes searches return NO results but when I search again a few minutes later it finds results. The app sometimes switches between Cloud and Prime without warning. Music stutters too much compared to other players. I can stream HD in YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix just fine but I can't listen to a song from Amazon without it skipping. The selection is limited. Sound quality is poor. I hear a lot of the connotation artifacts, that under water sound.  At least it works okay enough to audition a few tracks before it crashes. It will help me make some purchasing decisions, though I doubt they will be made through this app."
"October 26, 2016","Selection of music is very limited.... so many more apps that have a better selection, some even for free  Update: uses the hell out of my data. Pandora Spotify and the like do not use my cellular data deserves 0 stars. I unlike a song or anything similar to that song and it still plays crap"
"September 5, 2015","I love whole prime option. I am a disabled veteran that is home bound. I love music so the music part I really love. I have not got into the movie part yet but I plan to very soon. I bought a good blue tooth speaker that makes the music sound awesome. I wish this was all a little easier to work and learn. I have about 3500 songs but I know there are a lot of doubles. It would be nice to be able to have the app identify doubles and ask before before you down loaded it again. It seems like this might be something you want to control on your PC. I look forward to the movie part. I use prime to make purchases and I really like that part. Help to make the music more user friendly. Thanks"
"June 21, 2016","A great way to store and listen to music on any of my available devices. If you purchase a cd and it has a MP3 download, it is easy to find and play that on this app as well. A fantastic and easy app to use and be able to navigate through."
"October 4, 2016","While I actually like Alexa and having my music available. I have never had worse software. Amazon music crashes on my pc while trying to upload even 20 songs. My collection is over 25,000 songs. Don't even try and do the math, the misery this app has caused me is unbelievable. I get excited like a schoolboy each time there is an app update... wondering hoping its over and won't.. ... oh fiddlesticks never-mind it crashed again. I eventually get everything uploaded. It's torture but it works eventually. Use at your own sanities risk."
"November 13, 2016","So far I am really digging Amazon Music Unlimited and the new and improved app.. The selection is now top notch (if you pay for Music Unlimited) and the app works MUCH better than Apple Music on Android! Being that pretty much my entire purchased music library is on Amazon Music, Music Unlimited seemed like the no brainer choice for my music subscription service. So far I have been very impressed and would highly recommend it to anyone!! The app features full albums, stations, and playlist.. The app is easy to navigate!! The app is easy to download or stream.. And overall, I have had no issues with the app.. I highly recommend it"
"November 4, 2014","I do notice that on small occasion amazon ""greys out"" a choice, however compared to what the have you certainly can spend a lot time selecting what you want. I hope amazon does not raise their prices as so far, prime is worth the small increase. I notice amazon has gotten better about the freight and prime movies. Prime movies, however, has such a small offering I ususally just skip those as I don't want even accidentally trapped into further pricing. We own our own movies, plus have Netflix and Grandma goes to the movies with the grandkids so we are cool with amazon on the movie part. There has been times in the past you could log on to amazon and there was no movies in prime ...so we got used to it. Last month we ordered three complete boxed sets of movies so that will keep us busy."
"September 23, 2015","Amazon digital music downloads would do much better with increased time for listening to samples. In most instances, the listener never gets a good idea of the music because of the 30 seconds sample time. I often pass over songs that have a very limited sample of a song that I might otherwise buy. 30 seconds will give you an intro, or part of a verse, or perhaps part of a chorus or instrumental. I would rather know what I am buying when I am browsing for new music. At other sites they allow you to listen to the whole song! Also, allowing the user to choose the folder to download to would be nice."
"April 17, 2017","Amazon music is way better than Pandora or any other music listening app out there. I love it and it's the only one I use now. I've took all the others off my phone to free up storage."
"May 20, 2015","I'm paying for storage of songs and have about 80,000 uploaded. The player is super slow, erratic, and buggy. By buggy, it sometimes can't find songs and it crashes with great regularity. It also has a sucky interface. It is hard to figure out how to do things like build playlists. I know Amazon will eventually get this right, but for now, iTunes is a much better experience. I'd like to see Amazon puts some resources into this especially since it's a major part of Prime and they charged me for storing my music."
"November 8, 2017","Amazon music app developers: get your sh*t together. I've TRIED to use this app on a galaxy S7 for going on two years. I like that I can theoretically access music as part of my Prime membership instead of paying for a separate subscription. However, this app hardly ever does what it claims to be capable of. Music skips when I have a full wireless signal. I download music, but it just loads perpetually when I'm offline. Today I tried again and got a message that my downloaded music had expired and needed to be refreshed. BUT NOTHING HAPPENS WHEN I TAP ""REFRESH MY MUSIC."" Reinstalled the app, made no difference. This is such a joke of a product. Seems like really lazy development -- you're not making any extra off it, so why bother doing it right, right?"
"June 13, 2014","Works on the Google Nexus 7-2 tablet, Not on the Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. The functionality is straightforward and easy to use on the noted tablet. The app is totally messed up on the S3 phone. The only way to get music to play on the smartphone is in ""airplane"" mode. Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded didn't show up. On the phone, and trying to get to music via the cloud, Amazon blocks you from access to your music with a splash screen that holds you hostage from accessing music you've already paid for unless you agree to try Amazon Prime for 30 days. Advice: Boycott until they stop that and fix the app."
"October 28, 2014","I thought I was buying and downloading an MP3 file, not some file that sits in a 'library' server. First Amazon music purchase and now the last."
"February 20, 2017","Amazon Music has a good catalog of information available. However, the apps are missing many features that should be standard at this time.  1. The experience between web, desktop, and mobile apps are inconsistent. The feature sets are not the same across all the platforms. Play queue being an example. The play queue is available in the Android app but not in the web player.  2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling. I'm forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.  3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist. Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums. This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.  4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application. This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application. This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.  5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks. The ability to thumbs up / down or star tracks is sorely missed.  6. Video Content - None  7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms. If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.  8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow. It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing. This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.  9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to... Show me similar artist, records, songs. Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!  10. Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature. However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.  11. Android Screen controls. The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android. There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked (all competitors have this functionality).  Overall the service is adequate. There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market. I signed my family up for a year. They all hate it! We will give the service a fair shake over the year. If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again. I expected better from Amazon. Okay is not good enough."
"August 10, 2015","I don't want to stream music but I do want to download digital music I purchased from Amazon. This app did it. It also found every other MP3 file on my computer and added them to this app. I deleted them all from my hard drive and Amazon Music still has them listed among the albums I just purchased and downloaded. I just want to play music in my car from a USB drive. I don't need or want this nonsensical app.  After moving the recently purchased albums to a USB drive, Amazon Music decided to download them again. I look at the settings and there is apparently no way to turn this off.  This app is going to make me spend hours doing something that could be accomplished in minutes before Amazon forced me to download the app to buy music. As soon as I get my new albums copied from my hard drive, I'm going top delete this app and just not buy digital music from Amazon any more."
"August 21, 2015","Always something to listen to, new releases are released shortly after their debut, and the sound quality is very good for streaming with no buffering over LTE and wifi. The overall addition of this service makes it a much better value than n**flix. I don't watch movies every day but I will listen to music on my commute, Amazon got this right."
"January 6, 2015","Crashes every time I want to play a song that's downloaded to my device (android 4.4) whether or not I'm connected to the internet at the time. Of course, I downloaded my most played songs to avoid needing an internet connection every time I want to listen to music which means the app is basically useless to me. I CAN still play songs that aren't downloaded to my phone UNLESS they were previously downloaded. That's right, even if I remove the song from my library, trying to play it still causes the app to crash.  Update The app is now fully functional and allows me to play downloaded music as well as stream audio. The redesign isn't as easy to navigate as in previous versions, but it still gets 5 stars because the functionality is there."
"March 29, 2017","This thing is bad. I've used several others and this is by far at the bottom, which surprised me coming from Amazon. The way you upload a big library like I have to the cloud is atrocious. I have been trying for days to get my approximately 120GB's (and that isn't even that big of a library), up for days. On top of that, they should have an option to point to your music folder and keep track of your personal library and sync your library with your cloud, so its always up to date.  Amazon, get it together."
"January 26, 2017","Love Amazon music! It's great for listening to purchased music, and with Amazon Prime there are tons and tons of great music to listen to for free (not really free because you pay for a prime membership) but it's a wonderful perk and if used enough you get your money worth!! You can download music to play offline without data or wifi (perfect for airplanes). Would recommend this!!!"
"October 24, 2012","UPDATE: My original review was circa 2012. My how times have changed. The Amazon Music app is now my go to app for streaming music and listening to downloaded music. If you have Prime, take advantage of the stations, playlists and free music!  ORIGINAL REVIEW CIRCA 2012: I have used the AmazonMP3 app both for listening to and purchasing music directly to my phone since the app was first introduced. The app, mostly, performs as expected. It is simple and relatively easy to use. HOWEVER, the app does not allow you to download your music to your phone's SD card, it will only download to internal memory. This is a large inconvenience for those of us who do not always have a wifi signal or have 3g/4g data caps. I travel a fair amount of time and want to have my music available on those long flights. Plus listening to music on my phone's memory is much better on battery life than streaming.  Other MP3 app makers have addressed this in their apps. Google has recognized this issue with their Google Music app and has allowed download to SD since March 2012. Why Amazon cannot figure this out is beyond me. In the end this will hurt Amazon more than its users. We, as users, have choice and the ability to walk away from AmazonMP3 and choose another music vendor. I can say that I have withheld purchasing many albums from AmazonMP3 for this reason.  Until Amazon rectifies this omission from their app, I cannot, in good faith, give AmazonMP3 a positive review. 2 stars until this changes, 4-5 stars if Amazon gets on the ball and makes the fix."
"February 20, 2017","First off, the sound quality and selection is fantastic. I would rate that alone at 5/5. If you listen to a large variety of music on a regular basis, the service is great.  BUT, finding music, is a chore. Artists are easy enough to find, but actually getting to an album you want is tricky. The majority of my listening is full albums. From the album selector for a band, there is NO distinguishing between singles, EPs, or full albums, nor is there any note of year (year is visible once the album has been selected, but I've already seen several where the year was blatantly wrong, or listed the year of the re-issue, which is technically correct, but generally misleading). This is a NIGHTMARE for bands with several albums, especially artists who name the album after a title track, release the album, a clean version of the album, a limited edition of the album, the title track as an EP, and again as a single. It's common for me to ""view all"" albums, and it's 3+ indistinguishable links, all with the same album art and name.  I've also had technical issues stemming from album selection. For example, from the ""my recommendations"" screen, I can click to an album, and I can add the album to my music, but from the band's page, that album is NOT in their list (specific example below). Furthermore, a band's list of albums is not its own screen, it's a kind of popup, so when I select an album, if it's not the one I want, and I hit back, I am returned to the band's main page. Not their list of albums, forcing me to repeat this cycle.  For reference, the album I can listen to, but not find on the band's page is ""The Nexus"" by Amaranthe. I think the confusion there is that ""The Nexus"" is also a single, and there are two entries for said single in the band's album list, and I think one of them should be a link to the full album, but is not."
"June 10, 2015","Adding my voice here. Currently using up 3.52 GB of my usable 4.94 GB. Refuses to be relegated to SD card storage. Read about some app that will let you move your purchased music to SD but won't move prime music. I guess prime just has to be streamed if you want to use it. Look amazon, you demand all sorts of permissions in order to be on my phone. You can remove prime music at any time from my phone. You can keep it protected. You don't need to hog my internal memory. I guess you are only for top end phone users. I can't afford you.  Listen from the cloud you say? Unless I keep this app open on the front page, and don't let the phone display go dark, the music stops. I get about 15 seconds of music, then have to restart it.  So, I uninstalled the app, and guess what? It took the music I BOUGHT from amazon off my phone. Music that I use other apps to play since those apps don't stop every 15 seconds. Amazon, I love you. But I hate your music app."
"August 15, 2015","I love Prime music, but the delivery system (download/streaming) could be greatly improved. There seems to be way too many hiccups. Songs start and stop very frequently. Play button is still activated, but shutting it off and starting it back on doesn't resolve the stoppage. So... you skip to the next song. This is really the last thing any of us want to do: micro-manage our streaming music player instead of listening to music and doing other things while we listen (novel concept). I think the song rotation is better than I-Tunes but the stability of the player... not so much. Three stars might be a bit optimistic."
"December 23, 2015","this is the slowest app that I have experienced recently. It is slow to load, slow to update, slow to make changes (order of playlists). I can't believe a major organization like Amazon is putting this application in competition with Goolgle, Spotify, etc. The only advantage of this app is that it is cheap. But, functionally, it it terrible. I have been an Amazon customer an Prime member for 5 years, but I have to admit that their venture into the music world leaves a lot to be desired. Amazon, you can do better with the (almost) unlimited resources that you have. Spend some more time and money on this application and you could be the best, but if this is what you are willing to invest in this, users, please go elseware."
"December 7, 2013","I keep all my music on Amazon Cloud. I use this app to listen to my stuff on my phone. This latest update, 3.0.2 is the reason I gave it 2 stars. When you're listening to an album, you used to be able to add another to the ""now playing"" list. This is no longer an option. Also, the reaction time when you do something, (Skip a track...play a different album...scan forward in a track...) is significantly delayed.  Time for a version rollback :) I wish.  Another ""feature"" I just discovered: When you add an entire album(s) to a playlist, the stupid application plays the tracks in a random order. (I don't really know if it's random, I didn't qa test for randomness) This is mildly annoying for music, pull your hair out annoying for audiobooks."
"November 11, 2014","I share a membership and pay half with my 76 year old mother. Because it's in her name, I can't access songs that would be free. She has zero use for it. If only one person on Prime can get free songs and apps, we should be able to designate that member ourselves. I also couldn't download my purchase to my phone without it asking me to change my settings to allow downloads from ""unknown sources"". Who on earth would change settings on their phone to open it up to all? I've yet to log on to my computer to finish downloading it into my Amazon Cloud, and haven't even been able to hear it yet. The general permissions I had to accept for the app were way outside of normal apps, but making general changes to accept unknown downloads is nuts."
"September 3, 2016","Absolutely love this service!!! Probably one of the main reasons I continue my prime membership. I have XM radio and this service way out performs XM radio. I listen to Amazon Prime Music way more than XM now. I can pick my own songs and play it from my library or chose from the Prime library.  The only CON I can think of right now is Amazon Prime Music needs a COMEDY channel, that is the only reason I still have XM radio.  The views stated in this review are based off of my own experience and testing/comparison of this product against other similar products. I am not being paid to review this product nor will I take payment to review a product. If you think that my review was helpful, please press the YES button below."
"November 8, 2016","I used to LOVE Amazon's Music App, but with the recent change they eliminated a lot of features that I used and turned the app into something that is to me completely useless.  CONS  0) It's just slow, and laggy, and freezes all the time. While I'm uploading or it decides to download something (completely outside of my control) it can not be used.  EDIT***  Since the time of my originally posting this review amazon has introduced several updates that have incremementally begun to address my problem and I am so thankful for that. I had started using another music player but it is so much easier to have the program that i use to download my music also play it and it's great to see that a company as big as Amazon can listen to complaints and improve on products. I STILL want it to be a lot easier to remove music from my computer directly from the ap but they added the ""see file on computer"" option back again so if I really want to I guess I can use that. Thanks Amazon.  1) On the new app they have this extensive list/filtering system which is mostly redundant and yet so complicated I hardly ever know what subset of my music I am listening to. Is it my OFFLINE music, on the CLOUD, filtered by download date... or is it the ALBUMS section with ALL MUSIC, yet only purchased songs ordered by upload date? There is NOTHING smart about this set-up and it only serves to obscure the next point  2) I CAN'T STOP IT FROM DOWNLOADING EVERYTHING! I like to try out new albums/songs and support artists.. So I buy the album and keep it on the cloud and download my favorite songs for easy listening even without internet (yaknow if I wind up in the stone ages or something..) Maybe somewhere along the line I accidentally hit dl everything, although I don't believe that I did- but even so I can not find any setting that would be able to help me change that! furthermore they took away the ability to click on a song and find it on my computer which I could have potentially used to delete unwanted songs from my computer. AND NOW WHENEVER I TRY TO DELETE A SONG INSTEAD OF GIVING ME THE OPTION TO DELETE IT FROM THE COMPUTER OR THE CLOUD IT ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT THE CLOUD.  3) It's now more difficult than ever to donload or upload songs when I want to... having me drag and drop songs onto the words, upload or download is totally unintuitive especially since I usually like to deal in multiple songs.. which leads me to the INABILITY TO HIGHLIGHT MULTIPLE SONGS. That is a completely necessary/useful option that I don't understand the logic behind taking out.  4) When I click ""make a playlist"" from this song- nothing happens... I probably just do not understand what I was supposed to do maybe? But I am fairly computer literate and a programmer myself so if I can not understand it I assume that most are quite perplexed.  PROS  The color scheme is nicer... the icon looks good?  I originally was going to give this app a 2 star rating becuse I think the aesthetics really were an upgrade... but honestly there is such a downgrade in functionality this app is terrible now.. If there were any other way to easily download and listen to my music that I buy from Amazon I would be there right now.."
"April 28, 2017","I'm an international subscriber. I couldn't make use of my prime music nor videos. I couldn't even buy anything. My credit card is accepted for goods purchases but not for music or videos. Apple is doing a better job! Too bad."
"November 4, 2016","I am going to give this overall a rating of 2 for now and will come back and update if Amazon fixes these issues.  First I will say a few positives, the music selections are excellent vs. what they previously offered on Prime. I think $7.99 for Prime members for music unlimited is a very reasonable deal. Second I think the iPhone App is pretty good too. With each update it seems to get easier and easier to navigate.  Now the Cons - easy things to fix: 1. On the App, make the fonts bigger so a user can read what song, artist is playing without squinting. This should be a no brainer. With that said, most other music apps are just as poor in this area - not a good excuse though. 2. The music recommendations for offline mode - I have 1GB of space on my phone allocated to offline recommendations. It barely uses it and tells me my device is almost full. So I get one playlist as a recommendation and it won't try to add more. I have 2GB of space free on my device. I feel like I am missing out on a big part of what I am paying for, offline music.  Now the Cons - harder to fix, or at least very inconsistent and if you search Amazon help forums, others are complaining as well: 3. Integration with Echo - When I just had Prime Music and my own Cloud Library Echo worked great. Since the release of Unlimited which I accepted the free trial almost the first day, Echo is a wreck. It started off it seemed to only shuffle my Prime Unlimited music that I had added to my Library. I had a hard time getting Echo to my music I had uploaded. Then one day the exact opposite happened. It would only shuffle music I had uploaded. Even worse, it doesn't even shuffle on the command ""Echo Shuffle My Music"" or ""Shuffle Songs from my Cloud account"". On this command, echo starts with the same songs until I say ""shuffle"" again and skip a song. Then it says ""enabling shuffle mode"" and it shuffles. But the next time I do it again it picks a new different song to always start with. Obviously the Echo/Cloud logic is broken and needs to be fixed. It is flat out stupid how it works right now and I trust Amazon is working on it. At the same time I have been considering loading my 10,000 MP3s to Amazon Cloud for the $25 per year. No way I will do that if shuffle is messed up. 4. Related to #3, when I do use the shuffle command, it only plays songs I have uploaded. It does not shuffle in any songs that I have added through Prime Unlimited. I can play those songs or albums by explicitly asking for them, but they will not mix in with random shuffles. Again, a month ago this was opposite, I had a hard time getting my uploaded songs to play, only Prime songs will shuffle, now it is reversed.  I am a big Amazon fan. The App issues I can mange. The Echo/Prime Music execution is poor at this time. If this improves I will update my review."
"July 7, 2016","I was thrilled to see this app which will complement my prime membership. However, there is not enough prime music available. The app is mostly for selling music. I'd buy Spotify instead. I hope Amazon will improve the selection."
"November 21, 2016","I'm using the IOS app. It actually works pretty well. It seems that some albums in my library need a little update in the metadata, and it will be easier to find the stuff I'm looking for.  I've got about 30k songs in my collection. I'm trying to upload all those so that I can access them across all my devices (including my echo). The Amazon music program on the PC and MAC are by far the worst cloud upload program I have ever worked with. Let me list the problems:  1) I've got a 4-core 8-thread core i7 machine, it maxes out all my CPU in order to do 3 parallel streams of uploading. On my macbook pro, it shows 110% CPU on a 4 core machine. Uploading a file should not be a CPU intensive process. It slows down my entire PC, where typing stuff into a web browser is about 1 character a second. 2) The underlying threads kindof work (I get lots of ""Cloud Service Not Responding Errors""), you have to go back through and ask it to retry files one at a time. Because it's so slow, it takes about 30 seconds to actually select, hit retry, and click ""got it"" and have the popup dissappear. 3) The UI hangs, so you have no idea what it's actually doing. I have to resort to hitting refresh on the browser on the website to see what has actually been uploaded. It gives a popup when the upload is complete, but that only happens about 20% of the time (if you're uploading 5 songs at a time). If you upload like 100 songs at once, then it just hangs and shows busy forever (even hours after it completed uploading the last file). You have to quit the program, and go into the task manager and actually kill it. I now do that between every upload.  Amazon solutions are typically very good. The kindle programs work amazingly well. This one is total crap, which is a shame for an otherwise very good service (from what I can tell). If they can get this fixed, then their offering should be very competitive."
"July 8, 2015","How can this app STILL not allow you to save purchased music to an SD card? How simple was that to program!? OMG.. Fix or I'm setting all future teen purchases to Google Music from now on. This should never have been a issue! Being the best online retailer on the web, I was sure that this was the place to let my teen buy music for their Android phone.. until it FILLED UP THE PHONE'S SYSTEM MEMORY!! You wasted too much of my time figuring this nonsense out and to resolve the problem this app creates (going forward) involves taking out the SD card (periodically), and doing all sorts of rigmarole to reorganize the files onto the SD card via my computer?!! Don't BOTHER to suggest third party apps that can't GUARANTEE that all album images will move with the mp3s and be accessible by the CLOUD. Major fail... YOU SUCK. Sadly a great online retailer will be losing my music purchases due to lousy app."
"November 26, 2016","Best free download site (for Prime members). Allows offline listening on a number of devices (but as one would expect, no copying in sharable formats). Free music selection is very broad and I enjoy hundreds of songs on PC, tablet, and android phone. Good options for automatically downloading new library additions device by device. Also allows you to store owned music that CAN be shared -"
"July 1, 2014","This app is clunkier than Windows Vista. Heavy, unmanageable, buggy, and virtually unusable are the strong points. At least Amazon MP3 was intuitive and relatively usable. The first thing this piece of trash does is hit you over the head with a pop up ad for Amazon Prime. For all the money I spend at Amazon, I don't need the hard sell. You already get most of my money. Until now. Much of my purchased music did not transition from old to new. When I called MP3 customer service, I was advised to re-install the app. After the third time and significant language barriers, I gave up. Amazon sensed a problem when I hung up after being on hold for the 4th time. I received a call back asking if there was a problem. I said no, I was getting established with I-Tunes at the moment. Amazon sent an immediate email giving me a $7.98 credit to be used at their music store. Wow. What's next Amazon? World peace? Fire this non-beta testing software developer, give us a usable app, and I'll come back wagging my tail. Final thought: Amazon, you have impressed me since your name hit the streets. The fact that you're shoving this drek at us tells me you've lost your way. Disappointed? More than you know. Wow."
"June 16, 2014","Yesterday the Amazon mp3 app on my phone updated and went from a great app to one of the worst I've ever used. It's very frustrating because I can no longer save music to my sd card, the app has crashed several times, and I am getting a lot of download error messages. It is bad enough that I am considering going tomorrow and buying an IPhone and never buying music from Amazon again. Also a better Prime benefit would have been unlimited cloud drive storage for music rather than a million songs that just take up the very limited storage space on my phone or kill the battery if I try to stream it. It also would be a very good idea to make it available to use on the kindle fire and Fire TV."
"May 1, 2017","I have over 1000 songs on this app and I was absolutely loving it! It was included with my paid prime membership and was so nice. Good quality and everything. Then a new update came out and now I cannot add any music to my library because they are all now premium subscription. Now they are trying to make me pay extra to listen to music that was originally free!? And I have so many songs that if I don't upgrade to this new premium standard I have to either A: one by one download every song through a new app. Or B: Be forced to upgrade to keep my music. I thought amazon was awesome before and now they are getting greedy and I guess my money for prime is now not enough. Very disappointed"
"May 13, 2017","With Unlimited, this is now my go to music app! Spotify does have more of a wealth of playlists, but I think Amazon will continue to improve in that regard."
"November 5, 2016","I like having the option to listen to varied stations and my own list from anywhere. Maybe I haven't done enough research, but I do not know why one day I am able to listen to some songs, then the next they are no longer available to Prime members."
"March 2, 2017","Great option for prime subscribers, you can set up a library of your long lost music. Also listen to complete CDs before you buy. I really suggest looking into the library option."
"August 8, 2015","My Dad is a truck driver and he loves this app. manly because he can get all the music he likes into a playlist. He doesn't want to listen to other apps like Pandora because he wants to hear what he likes. This app lets him do that. Most of the music he likes is free to him with my prime amazon membership. Its easy for him to use, he is over 60 and has technical difficulty with working devices but this is easy for him."
"November 2, 2015","I like this app but we recently just started using it more and I realized that the library of Prime is very mainstream. We listen to a multitude of stations that play songs I've never heard before and when searching for quite a few of those songs, they are not found. The app is used on an Android and loads sufficiently, but connection could be dependent upon carrier. Overall, I am glad I have it, but I hope that the available tunes will be expanded to those that are less mainstream, and leave you wanting more after hearing them play on Sirius."
"February 28, 2017","Trying out the 1-month free membership as an add-on to my Prime membership. They seem to have added a large selection of music to the library, the player is much more visually appealing, and the user interface is more user friendly. However the search feature rarely gives the results I am looking for, and I cannot search only in ""Playlists"" or ""Stations""... The biggest complaint I have with this version of Amazon Music is the amount of CPU power and memory it has requires from both my laptop (Dell Inspirion 15 7000 Series) and my phone (Samsung Galaxy S7). On my laptop I notice an immediate lag in the operation when I open the app. Amazon Music consumes the most CPU power and is the second largest user of memory. Since I've installed the app on my phone, my battery is down to 50% by lunch and by 5 P.M. I will have less than 5% battery life. Typically, I have about 35% to 45% battery life on my phone at 5 P.M... I have been using this app for about a week and I doubt I will continue with it after the free trial."
"May 24, 2015","I have a Moto X running KK 4.4.4 with this app version 4.4.4 (interestingly enough). I actually really like this app as a Prime Member but the one GIANT mess up that I see is the need for data even to play music that is downloaded. I ask you... what is the point of me downloading the music at all if I still need Data to play it???? You guys fix this and I will update my rating. You will see in my screen shot I enabled Airplane mode to emulate data loss and show you what is happening. I experience this in a natural way constantly as I happen to live out in the country side and have plenty of areas of travel that have little to no data which makes the idea of downloading music popular to me."
"September 30, 2013","Won't download to my refurbished Kindle Fire (1st gen)! I had to download the ""TuneIn Radio"" app (free version) in order to get the ""Amazon MP3"" app. The ""AMP3"" app is INSIDE the ""TIR"" app. The ""AMP3"" app is located in the upper right hand-corner. And note, you have to be in playing mode in order for that icon to appear. Works good as such. I've been able to make purchases, access Cloud, and download to my device. Sweet."
"December 19, 2016","I hate typing bad reviews, but maybe Amazon may listen. I have been using the Amazon Music app on my computer for a few years, so I have experience with it. I am also a Web Developer, so I know how to use a computer. When the latest updates for this app arrived, I was immediately put off. If all you do is play music, it works fine. Uploads are not intuitive at all.  In the older version, when you wanted to upload music, you added it by choosing a file/folder with a browser, or you dragged files/folders onto the app. Then, you saw the list of songs with an uploading icon next to the ones in queue, and the finished ones indicated as such. After uploading, you could clear the queue, so the next time you upload something, you could see exactly what was happening.  Now, you drag files/folders onto the app, as before, but only the songs that are actively uploading or finished are displayed. Unless you counted, you have no idea how many are left to upload. They only get added as they upload. And the queue list shows everything you have ever uploaded, so if I want to see what is in progress, I have to find it in the list. I have thousands of songs. Unless I search for the songs that are uploading, I have no idea it is even working.  This app would be much more useful for me if it would bring back the old upload method. Everything else is not bad."
"December 15, 2014","Only gave this 2stars because my finger slipped when i tried to give it 1.Buggy and inconsistent, stupid, unreliable, needlessly complicated, totally unnecessary BS!!! I understand that all websites have a mission to make everything proprietary, but proprietary apps should WORK CORRECTLY!!! Remember the good old days when you could just buy an mp3 from amazon and they would just let you download it and enjoy it? Then came the mandatory cloud player, now the mandatory app. Every time i upggrade to a new device amazon makes it harder and harder to download my music library tomy harddrive. This app works less well every time ihave to use it. On my thirdvattempt to download my music to new tablet and half the mp3s simply cant download correctly, even though they downloaded just fine to my previous tablet 6 wks ago. Tried it on several different networks to be sure its not just screwing up due to bad wifi; network is fine. Never paying another dime to amazon for music as long as i live. Enough is enough with this crap."
"April 25, 2017","I would definitely rate this app higher if it could be used for my entire family but a HUGE disappointment is that when Prime is purchased, only ONE person in the house is able to access Amazon Music. This is ridiculous! If one purchases Prime for a household, then everyone in the family should have access to the music. Music was a huge reason we purchased Prime. It was a great disappointment when we discovered only one person in our household could access the music. It made our overall opinion of Prime less attractive for our family."
"April 19, 2017","IT NEVER WORKS. ""sorry this content is no longer available"" EVERY DAY. In fact, NEVER has this ""free"" music bovine excrement ever worked properly. I personally will go back to music the Old School way. I love an artist. I SUPPORT THAT ARTIST WITH MY FREAKING WALLET AND BY THE ALBUM, you know, a tangible object that you can see and touch and HEAR EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU PLAY IT. streaming......bovine excrement."
"April 26, 2012","UPDATE September 25, 2013: Since first using this with my old (and long gone) Droid X this software has deteriorated in one big way. On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon (which also sold me the 64gb SD card.) This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. It's a no-win situation.  Original Review: No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend (not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!)  What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it's immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.  Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.  Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 (or more), each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs (i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.  As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider (Verizon) instead of any shortcoming with Amazon. Just be aware that it can be an issue of the underlying technology, including your service provider's infrastructure.  Despite my complaints, I have reached the point where I cannot live without the app, so I guess liking it is optional."
"July 21, 2017","I would put no stars but I can't. I cannot use this app without a so called membership. Even though I have one. It keeps asking me to start free trial or make a payment. But ive already signed up, and am able to use the kindle book app and the Amazon prime video. So why music isn't recognizing my account I don't know. But I've already called twice about this Amazon prime. It sucks having to constantly call for this stuff."
"September 22, 2015","I hardly ever use this app but keep it on my phone to play music when i buy a new CD while I wait for it to arrive (yes I prefer actual cd's to lossy mp3's).  This app is constantly waking the phone to refresh something. It's always towards the top of the list for battery usage even if I haven't touched it all day."
"December 10, 2012","I have used the ""other"" Mp3 player for years and never liked it. It took up too much room in my devices and is unique to it's own products. I am a freedom loving person and the Cloud player let's me be free. I can buy from many sources and the best part is it doesn't eat up any space on my electronics. The sound quality is superb. Ease of use excellent. When I had a problem today I talked to a specialist in 3 minutes. He took me thru a little tutorial and now I know a lot more than I did before. The streaming has been uninterrupted.  It is an easier, friendlier option to the other one and I am very happy to let Amazon store my music until I want to hear it. I have nothing bad to say about it. If you are new to Mp3 music streaming, I recommend, without hesitation, that you start here. I  I have read the bad reviews and I am sorry to hear people have had trouble with it. My experience has been excellent with all of my devices. Perhaps they have finally worked a lot of the bugs out of it. Anybody who has used Facebook knows about software bugs! Maybe my expectations weren't high. But my experience with Amazon and The Cloud player system overall has been better than most companies I deal with. As I said, I would recommend it to everyone!"
"October 14, 2015","It's gone from mediocre to freaking horrible. I left itunes because they screwed up their program a two years ago. And recently amazombie followed suit. It takes twenty minutes for me to access the music and it's molasses if I try to add a new playlist. It's the freaking cloud connection. Let me download all the music and you fix the problem. You can still manage the digital rights and we don't have to wait for your crappy servers to decide to let me access my music. Most disappointing amazon experience by far.  Update May 2017 - They seemed to have streamlined the software code. Running better. Still kind of slow but a useable experience."
"February 4, 2016","Received when I signed up for prime I normally use Spotify I like the fact that there is no commercials making a playlist works yet it does not allow you to import the playlist from Spotify. You have got to solve this problem also if I want to sort my playlist for instance alphabetically or when added to the playlist on the app it doesn't allow me to do that I have to manually sort everything. All in all I'm happy with it but you guys have a lot of improvements that you have to make to catch up"
"November 2, 2014","Great idea but still (in 2014) limited: does not work in Windows phones (no app), tries to show the cover shot of the selection with often hilarious results (minor issue), and limits playlist size, which annoys me because I have classical, jazz and blues in one big file but can separate them in playlists. Loading ""songs"" is tricky (don't like calling a concerto a song), seems to work better with Windows Media Player references than with iTunes references (on a Windows computer), and most nearly dependably if simply directed to the drive folder containing the music files. I still think it is the most economical way to make a cloud protection copy of a large library, having first tried Apple's cloud."
"August 28, 2016","This app is horrible the interface is clunky and hard to use, for instance the song options in the music library are right under the slidy bar so you scroll down find the song your looking for got to bring up the options and it sends you wizzing off to some other corner of the library because you clicked the scroll bar! Total garbage save your self the frustration and just avoid this whole s***show."
"July 20, 2017","I figured that after a little time and updates Amazon would have this app cleaned up, this is not the case. App crashes on a daily basis Music skips when it tries to find wifi signal for my offline music. Why would it need wifi for offline music? Music selection is limited and put together poorly No information given about music selections Suggested music is a joke I have to constantly uninstall and reinstall PC version of the app because it says it can not connect to internet Worst part is that I am paying for this crap. You have let me down Amazon"
"May 19, 2016","I have just subscribed to this assuming I can replace Spotify/Napster/Apple Music to stream music with. Maybe I'm missing something, but it doesn't seem to have a great deal of music. When using any of the other apps I've mentioned, I can type in anything that pops into my head, and the chances are pretty high that they'll have it. This thing doesn't even have entire catalogues of certain artists. Joan As Police Woman, for example. It has one Radiohead song. One! I mean, are they adding stuff all the time? Is this as good as it's going to get?! If this is it, I can't help wondering what its point is."
"December 24, 2016","Wake up Amazon. You do a lot of great things, this app is not one of them. If you want to compete with Spotify etc. you need to at least meet if not exceed their functionality. Get a good User Experience person to take a hard look versus the competition. Its hard to stop the app from running all the time. There is no simple QUIT option in the menu. It sticks itself in your notifications dropdown but clicking X there does not quit the app. Sometimes it feels like an annoying mosquito app. I love Prime and might consider upgraded music option and cancel spotify, but not with this APP experience. Please get some focus here and fix the User Experience here on this app."
"December 18, 2013","I have tons of music on the cloudplayer and cant install cloud player on my Kindle. I have Premium service too. Very disappointed."
"December 12, 2013","I've only used this app a few times. The sound is good and it's handy, but each time I've used it when I'm done listening and want to move on, I can't seem to find a way to turn this app OFF! None of the usual ways seem to work, and the controls only seem to give the option to pause not stop. Very hard to find a way to close the app. I've ended up restarting my phone just to get it shut off a couple of times. So although it's a convenient way to play the music I bought but forgot to download, I probably won't use it anymore."
"July 2, 2015","Searching for songs is near impossible. I'll be searching for music, type the name of the artist and nothing comes up. Type the first few letters of the album name from said artist and the album instantly comes up. Various other flaws in the app but that is by far the most annoying. Love the ad free streaming and audio quality is pretty good when you're actually able to find the music you are searching for. Bottom line, I expect better from Amazon. This has a beta version feel and experience. Their shopping app is fantastic, this music streaming app falls far far short."
"August 20, 2016","I like the variety, but their analytics suck. I like listening to instrumental music while studying, but I get tired of only classical. So I choose other artists like piano guys, and I do not want to keep saying I do not like the same music on that channel over and over again. I want only instrumental with artists that do instrumental. I had to do a thumbs down 4 times in an hour for Whitney Houston alone on a channel for a composer that only does instrumentals. Please hire someone from Pandora to fix your issue!!!"
"December 6, 2014","The problem with amazon prime instant video and amazon prime music is that amazon removes media out of the clear blue. One minute your movie and music are there. The next minute they are gone. without warning. At least with netflix, there is a heads up of what movies will be no longer offered as part of their service. Overall I think the amazon prime service is a ripoff considering what it offers. The 2 day shipping is great but that part isn't always executed to perfection, especially when it comes to 3rd party sellers (marketplace). You would have to buy a lot of product to really get your hundred dollars worth. The media selection part of prime (music and movies) is barely good enough."
"June 19, 2016","Love Amazon music! Tons of freedom complete albums from all eras and genres. Plus great playlists and singles. As a bonus you can listen from the cloud or your device or desktop. Reasonable pricing if you want to buy instead. Really no downside. Plus all the benefits of prime video and prime for shopping. It's the only service I need to subscribe to."
"January 29, 2016","I don't get it. Sure you can get the app push play on some channel until you maybe find something you like. But if you search for songs pick them, supposedly download them.... They are no where. I don't have the cloud. They are not in the amazon music file or amazon mp3 file thet must download with the app. That is all empty. But there....under Audible..... are unmoveable, unopenable (my) music that I as a paying prime member ""downloaded"" to listen to. WTFrak."
"November 19, 2015","I tested it out a few days ago and I really like it! It has high quality music and I really love that you can even read the lyrics and sing-along with the song of your choice! It's very convenient for me since I don't need to go online and search for the lyrics of the song! My only problem is that sometimes I find it really hard to look for a certain song. Whenever I tried searching for a specific song, it's not the right one. So I have to go and look for the albums one by one. It's a hassle for me. Hope they'll fix this though."
"February 11, 2017","I have been purchasing all of my music on Amazon for the past several years. I purchase and download all of my music and generally have never streamed it, this was the first time. I only downloaded this app to my phone because I wanted my daughter to be able to play some select songs in the car. When I did the download I specifically chose not to start the ""service"" but just to add the app in order to play the music I had purchased, but in the process saw that prime (of which I belong) had some music groupings that might interest me. We enjoyed playing the music in the car for a short time using the app because I hadn't downloaded the music to my phone. It took a while before I realized the thing didn't shut off. Got to work one day went to task manager and closed the app. Got out of work and realized it was still playing and had been ALL day, and using up my data. Pulled down the drop down menu and there it was, still playing. Just picked up my phone this morning and realized it has been playing some unknown music all night.................it's gone, going back to hooking up the phone and downloaded my purchased music that only costs me ONCE."
"June 17, 2014","Two primary things about this app.  1. It constantly loses your playlist options. Add a couple songs, switch to a new album to add some more and the first ones are gone making it impossible to play songs from more than one album. Same artist loses track as well.  2. The UI for the application is one of the most difficult to navigate compared to other music apps. Be prepared to tap through screen after screen to find what you want. Items with a prime discount are not clearly represented and intermixed with everything else, as well as one screen showing you they're $0.00 and another showing the same song as one you have to buy for $1.99. Also be prepared to have 1/2 the songs on an album free to stream but you have to pay full price for the album. Not sure if that's due to an industry deal or not but seems bogus when buying the other half the songs costs less than the cost of the album.  I was very excited when I thought I might be able to listen to music on my phone instead of carrying an iPod as well as the phone, but I'm keeping the iPod. Amazon has created just one more mediocre half-baked Amazon product. Very disappointed but not at all surprised."
"March 15, 2015","Awesome Sausce !!! Being a prime member, you get tons of free music to listen to from the best choices ever, all generations from the time they started recording music. I Love this. And I don't have to use tons of storage on my CPU to be able to listen to my music, & it's available through all of my devices, Kindle Fire, Cell Phone & Laptop. To listen to anywhere & anytime I choose. Thank You Amazon & All of the Awesome Musicians that share there musical talent & gift with the rest of us out here."
"April 30, 2016","With all the free music apps out there it makes no sense to own this app. I'd rather put up with pop-up ads that pay for the music then have me pay for it. 1200 songs I have and never paid a cent"
"December 3, 2016","I *hate* the new user interface. I use the app on my FireTV with a Logitech Harmony remote (so no voice control - a worthwhile sacrifice to consolidate all remotes). The new interface completely does away with the ability to jump alphabetically through your songs and albums. You now have to scroll all the way through your library staring with the numbers and slowly making your way through each and every title in your library. I have hundreds of albums and thousands of songs. This interface change has made the music app useless to me, and negated a big part of the reason I bought the FireTV in the first place. I really hope to see this addressed soon."
"May 18, 2014","I've finally cut the ties with all Apple devices and no longer have any need for iTunes. I especially love this app on my Galaxy S4 while driving in my car using blutooth. The only problem I have is sometimes albums are split into multiple folders. I was amazed to find that all the mp3's that I've ever purchased from Amazon showed up on my device as available to stream!"
"November 10, 2017","The app works great on my Android and my new iPhone only problem is trying to find music made by the original artist.unless you want to hear 1 album at a time and stop after 8 or 10 songs to search again. if your looking to listen to a mix of songs Plan on wasting hours searching and searching through endless cover bands or remade songs or remixed songs from artists I’ve never heard of doing original Artist songs."
"March 25, 2014","1. The Amazon MP# player does not have a setting to store the music off of your internal memory. I travel a lot on business and only downloading 6 albums is not enough. To move your mp3s to an external SD card in your phone takes using ES File Explorer or similar app.  2. The problem is even if you do that the Amazon MP3 app will not find it on the SD card. I ended up trying to use the built in music player on my Samsung Galaxy S4 but wait! the file names are now corrupted. Basically Amazon has chosen to add their gibberish looking item numbers to the front of file names such as B00134NFVG_(disc_1)_02_-_You're_No_Different. This makes it impossible to index on other players. So much for no copy protection take your music anywhere. It has changed to take your music anywhere through Amazon's player, and stream it even though you have to pay your cell carrier extra for the 250mb per 30 minutes it takes to steam music because we won't let you store the music on external storage.  3. I have over 11,000 tracks on Amazon Could but only pick and choose a handful to download. When I stream or download the songs the albums show tracks in the wrong order. Try listening to Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon out of order. (There are many albums produces in a certain order & Amazon screws this up - been like this for years. Never fix it)  3. I am also having issues with a single album being indexed by Amazon as two to four different albums each with a few songs on them. Click play album {so and so} and it will play 3 or 4 tracks and stop. Pull up the app and you will see where they are split up incorrectly.  This app used to be pretty decent but it has gotten much worse over a few years. Now I am going to search for a new alternative whether it is Google, Apple or just manage it on a home server and keep 3rd parties and the music industry out of it."
"November 3, 2014","But it's terribly broken. First of all, this new &#34;Amazon Music with Prime Music&#34; only works on certain devices. The old &#34;Amazon MP3&#34; app worked perfectly all the time. Second, when it works, you get Constant &#34;nag&#34; screens &#34;reminding&#34; you in the most intrusive way possible to try out Amazon's new Prime Music service. These nag screens can be dismissed, but they intermittently continue to pop up. Finally, the newest update won't even open without crashing and it keeps trying to open itself and ends up in a &#34;crash loop&#34;. They should have just left it alone, now I can't listen to any of my music. I guess I'll have to export everything, and start using Google music."
"July 1, 2015","As much as I love Amazon, this app is atrocious. The MP3s that I upload have solid, complete tags with album art embedded and without fail, Amazon Music continues to split albums and ignore my embedded album art. I can understand occasional hiccups with such a vast repository, but this Amazon Music library system is well beyond buggy.  If I had to guess, I'd say the app is actually working as intended, but the database and index system that exist in the cloud is so anemic and antiquated, that it can't handle the simple and fundamental functions that I've come to expect from a music library application.  Please review and consider an overhaul, Amazon. I love Prime, love my FireTV and love Echo, but this music system doesn't deserve to be included in that list. Sorry."
"May 12, 2016","It's my main music source. Only issue I ever have is with Bluetooth headphones,Amazon music will distort with to much bass,sounds great on corded headphones,I've tried several Bluetooth headphone sets,same result. Every update I hope it's fixed,but never happens. I don't get this problem with any other music source. It would be a 5 star app if not for this issue. I've also checked with other people,they get the same problem."
"June 21, 2016","I am extremely happy with this app. It is easy to search, download, and play the music. The variety of music is also an asset. I can now play my favorite music where ever I go. At the pool, beach, or even in the car, I've also used it while walking my dog for exercise."
"August 15, 2016","this was great, til the latest update for my phone. the icon disappeared, cant find it in my apps. when i go to re download it amazon says you already own it and doesnt install it. basically, either the phone or the app say its on the phone, but it cant be seen on the phone and amazon or the phone wont let it re install.. frustrating."
"November 27, 2015","We used this on my Samsung Galaxy S5. I connected to my car stereo via auxiliary cable and played Christmas songs. I do not like that skip feature is limited and they wanted me to pay to skip more often. I also wish there was more of Disney type based Christmas play list for the kids. My girls respond better to the Sprint Disney playlist I used later. I will probably play with this feature more in the future as I am paring down some of my Comcast features for more affordable options."
"June 2, 2017","I'm a fan of Amazon, but this app has lobotomized my music collection so many times. In addition to causing my phone to choke into freeze mode, the app isn't easy to use. Furthermore, it won't let you put your Amazon-bought music into a folder of your choice to live with your other music. In addition, it heavily favors streaming, which isn't why I *buy* MP3 albums! I want to *have the MP3 on my device* to save on data and play when I have no signal. *Not everyone lives where they have good, constant signal!* This app is too reminiscent of iTunes and its user-adverse interface and method of railroading the user into using *only * this app...if the app was decent and allowed me to play and use non-Amazon music *without choking my phone to death,* maybe I'd use it. This is far below Amazon's usual stellar standards."
"September 20, 2016","I love the prime music. I have put together a mix of music to listen to during my work day. Anyone that knows me knows how much I love music. Since my Ipod is on the outs I have used Amazon Prime music nearly every day. I listen to it while I am mowing, doing my walk in the evenings, at work and in my truck. Great benefit to having Prime."
"November 20, 2015","Prime Music may not be one of the most popular o well-known of the Prime services, but it was one of the main reasons I joined. My main use for it was to download music to my phone for listening offline, mostly in the car. Notice I said ""was"", because recently that functionality has stopped working for me. I am unable to download music from my cloud library to my phone, making Prime Music mostly useless for me. I will probably keep Prime, as I do like the other parts of Prime, but I am very disappointed that Prime Music isn't working as it should."
"July 6, 2016","I used to love this app recently it stops playing music after one song. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the same problem is occurring. I also do not like the fact that the app starts on startup & permissions cannot be changed. I have amazon prime but the music app is lacking."
"March 27, 2017","There should be an option for zero stars. Amazon music support is nonexistent. It has been outsourced to the Phillipines. The music stops streaming after 3-5 songs. I know it's not my system as I don't have the problem with pandora, Spotify, Netflix or any other steaming apps. They can't even transfer you to someone in the US if you request it."
"July 18, 2017","First impressions after a week of use: Love it! Coming from Pandora I am almost overwhelmed with what to listen to next. I love Pandora, but it is not like this. I'm not sure I will like the price once the reduced cost trial ends. And I still need to figure out if I can make it work with my Yamaha surround system."
"July 18, 2017","Love just about everything about this app. I can share my music easily on all my devices, computer, tablet and phone. It's easy to access and it shows how many songs and how long my playlist will last. Makes it easy to plan my listening day."
"September 30, 2016","I got this app and paid the extra for the year to have MY music be available to me. Instead, every time I open it I have to wade through Amazons's music to get to mine. Wish I could shift it around and have it always default to MY music instead of always promoting others music first."
"May 30, 2016","Dear Amazon,  Can you please add a Music Visualizer to this app? pretty please? I'd love to play my Prime Music playlists through the tv box on my projector when i have guests (who are usually inpressed by the app's sophistication and music variety) but no one wants to stare at the prime music menu pg all evening. Putting on the app then having ppl witness as I go back to start up a seperate visualizer kinda... undermines the app's quality....  IF you ALREADY have Amazon prime because you like 2-day shipping and knowing your getting a great deal without sacrificing peace of mind.... then there literally is ZERO reason to forgo free access to thousands of (downloadable) songs available on Prime Music.....Unless, of course, you're from some bizarro universe, in the multiverse, where in 2016, people still pay for music you can access on for free w/ pandora, spotify, etc.  Meant as a call to action rather than an insult, if u have Prime, do yourself a favor and check out prime music..... maybe also try moving away from your ""aol.com"" email address, if u still have one? Digital literacy is no longer luxury, but necesity. It includes trying out new things because you may find you like said new things.  Last but not least, to those of you who are complaining about the app downloading ur ENTIRE library to ur device... its time to tinker with ur in-app settings, because this app is rather light and agile for the range of functionality it has (and will def be the best once they add a visualuzer to the app, providing seamless engagement opportunities across user devices)"
"June 6, 2017","You have really screwed up listening to music using Amazon. I will go back to listening to Pandora or Music Choice on my TV. I ALEADY PAY FOR PRIME WHICH IS A JOKE BECAUSE MY PACKAGES HAVE BEEN LATE 4 times since December."
"August 11, 2017","It's an ok player but nothing great. It will download the songs I've purchased from Amazon so I have them locally. I can not differentiate between them and ones I've put on the SD card directly from my computer. The browse or search buttons search online but not my own database for specific songs. I liked the older versions of Amazon Players I used in the past better. They seemed to do a better job of managing large data bases with thousands of songs that are on the SD card."
"October 23, 2017","it's better than google music or spotify, your playlists can be lost on your offline library and I've had to reinstall a couple times, BUT it is way easier to recreate your playlists and library more so that google music. I also like the online playlist options but it won't work with local on device music that you have, it has to be online. and it needs WAY more music options. But it's ok."
"June 22, 2017","It is strange that a behemoth like Amazon cannot do better with Amazon Music. Everything about the service is second rate, the home page is embarrassingly antiquated, and with no way to adjust the useless Recommendations we end up with links to an endless variety of slop we are not even mildly interested in. There is literally not one compelling reason to use Amazon Music instead of TIDAL or Google Play."
"August 4, 2017","A good catalog of music to select from ! The only flaw, would be that they don't have all of the albums, for some artists' discographies The stations, who are named after specific artists, offers a great mix of music to listen to all day long!"
"October 1, 2017","I use Amazon Music all day everyday. It's my source of music. I utilize Alexa in my apartment and the Amazon Music app while mobile with my Pixel XL. I love it! Today I noticed Alexa was integrated with the app. This has been a feature I've desired for awhile now, however, you have to tap the Alexa icon in the Amazon Music app to activate the voice commands. I know it was probably no small feat to integrate Alexa into the app so I'm even considering my three stars a bit harsh. For the sake of experience I'm giving this three stars because of the Alexa integration. Hopefully this critizisam encourages even more innovation. The experience would be even more perfection if when the app was open I could use voice commands with Alexa when my phone was locked or unlocked without having to touch any GUI. It would make my experience with the app even more delightful if I could do that while walking my dogs or jogging. Hands free Alexa while mobile...now that would be amazing! 🙃"
"March 9, 2015","I have a Galaxy S5, and all my problems with it were related to the Amazon Music Player. It swallowed up my internal memory and really messed with the phone operation. So heres the deal, it by itself does not function on a phone at all, because thats the only place it works inside your Internal Memory. It's like they adapted a less sophisticated software to rush it to the market and went with it. They fixed the problem by making you discover through phone failure by reading reviews or by another means that they recognized the problem and really want to just sell you another app and download Amazon Apps. You will need to download their Amazon MP3 Mover in order to move songs to your SD Card. But it doesn't always work. It leaves off artist names and titles often so it has a lot of bugs. While the Amazon Player will not see the titles that it moves, the Android Music player will, so go figure. I really liked Amazon Music Player until I realized what it does not do. So one star, because Amazon knows the problems and can't seem to get it right. Really who can store all their music in Internal Memory. Take you mind off drone delivery which will never fly, and deliver your music....."
"November 5, 2016","Looks like Amazon is pushing people to Itunes with the latest iteration of Music.The prior app was relatively stable and offered music afficionados a reasonable interface for downloading their digital purchases. With the new ""blue"" release, I am back to downloading .ZIP files like it's 1999! This poor interface takes away the entire incentive of skipping cd purchases.  As a prime member who purchases both hard and digital media, I am no longer purchasing digital (unless it's dance music), instead I will go back to CDs and rip them myself.  Amazon, this iteration is complete crap. You can do better than this!"
"June 29, 2014","UPDATE:  I find that I use this app less and less. I think the most annoying part is that it ALWAYS tries to sync to your cloud library as soon as you launch it. On the surface, this isn't a bad thing. But the problem is when you don't have solid data coverage or wifi, like in a tunnel or in a building with thick walls. As it tries to sync, the app freezes and you can't do anything but force close it.  Ideally, there should be an option to sync only on wifi or manually by pressing a button. I have several albums downloaded/cached locally and never stream. So the app should just play those local albums and forget about trying to sync any other songs I have in the cloud. Sheesh.  ___________ I downloaded this app to take advantage of the Prime Music. It's actually not a bad app, even if you don't have Prime or don't purchase music. It recognizes/plays non-DRM music that's already on your phone. I find the interface to be simple, responsive, and not annoying. I like it a little more than the Google Music app. And it's much better than all those free apps that either have limited features or annoying ads, unless you pay up.  I'll also echo my complaint here about not being able to store Prime/purchased music on the SD card. It's really strange. You can move the actual app to SD card, but not any of the music. In a perfect world, we'd have unlimited/reliable mobile data everywhere we go and can stream music on a whim. But the reality is, we still need to download/cache locally to our mobile devices. Hopefully, Amazon will release a future version of this app that will allow you store purchased music on the SD card."
"June 22, 2016","I love Amazon prime music I haven't listened to music like this sense my 20'S and 30'S they make it so easy I have 6 different Playlist so easy to add too. I love even the stations no advertising just music any way to many perks to even try to list them all"
"July 18, 2017","Nearly perfect. I did need to re-install the app following problems. I bought an Anker Bluetooth speaker, and I needed to re-install the app on my smart phone. Once I did it runs perfectly. Until then it was frustrating."
"June 17, 2017","This is my go to music app and I find it easy to understand. I can compile my own playlists. If you upgrade to Amazon unlimited (79/yr for prime members) a vast amount of content is at your disposal. You can still use the prodigious content of just the Amazon Prime content, if you don't want to pay."
"March 5, 2017","The page needs to be refreshed a lot- an issue never experienced with spotify. It's not as bad as youtube where for each video/song you need to click on the tab/window again. (Then again youtube can be used for free.)  Aside from random pausing of music, there is a decent selection of music- some artists I wasn't expecting them to have. Although, many artists are not available and very few are available with a full album collection.  It works for me since I already have prime, which is well worth it for how much I order. I'd give it 4 stars without the streaming errors and 5 with a better selection."
"January 15, 2017","The selection is much smaller than most other streaming services, and Amazon Music doesn't even have all of the music which Amazon sells, meaning I can't even use it to listen to many of the CDs I bought with Amazon.  Then, if I want to download my music I've bought with the ""AutoRip"" that Amazon emails me about every time I buy a compatible CD, that's awful, too. If you buy a CD on BandCamp - a much better service if you're buying albums digitally - it asks you what file format you'd like. Amazon Music doesn't; Amazon Music says you'll get .mp3 and you'll like it. Of course, Amazon Music doesn't give you just any .mp3, because they had the forethought to give you your music in 292kbps. That's right, Amazon Music gives you decidedly lower quality music than other services. For a service built around music, Amazon Music should offer at a minimum 320kbps or V0.  If you care about quality, I wouldn't bother. I know I won't ever use it again unless I can download a lossless rip."
"November 24, 2016","why in today's world do updates always seem to mean making things worse. this app was ok before. not great by any stretch of the imagination, but it worked 'ok'. now it does not work ok. it is even less user-friendly, more clunky, unwieldy and just difficult to use. i cannot comprehend how or why this could have happened. i understand apple's music player on iphones is designed to be clunky to 'subliminally' push people towards their paid content. but i don't understand this. we are already paying for eg prime.  my recently added playlist contains only one album, that was not recently added. it doesn;t include any of the music i have bought in the last 48 hours. this does appear in the purchased playlist though. downloading to my mac now appears to take 1000% longer than it did. and the format of naming artists and albums has changed. you can't use the shift key to select multiple items to download. it is awful.  amazon - answer your ""prime"" customers - what are you playing at???? sort this sh8t out!!!!"
"October 14, 2016","There are other apps that are more intuitive but I have to use this one for prime downloads. I get mixed up between my music, prime, and prime downloads. Can be much more intuitive and easy to navigate. Sincerely a client code writer."
"February 27, 2016","I was surprised to find the perk along with Prime.I was curious about Jimi Hendrix' body of work in his short career and life.All of a sudden, I'm hearing music at a plethora level, in a short while, I was playing along on guitar that I previously had searched for even briefly. I know that makes me singularly unenterprising. But I found exactly what I wanted in complete. In short, I'm totally happy with Prime music access. Try it."
"April 8, 2017","I love the radio stations and playlists, and love being able to put my own collection up there. I listen at work all day."
"August 8, 2016","It's a little difficult to navigate, but otherwise i like it. I wish it had an off switch! I also wish it was a bit more clear which music was free for Prime members. I thought a certain album was going to cost me $10, then it ended up free. That was a good thing. I'm worried that I'll end up being charged for music I think is free. Very confusing for some who is new to this!!!"
"December 9, 2013","Latest version is horrible. Performance is worse and the app is now buggy. The UI hasn't improved and think it is worse than previous version. They also got rid of some features like adding song to playlist directly from song vs. now having to edit through the playlist. Good job Amazon, guess will now have to look for a new player."
"October 10, 2015","I have been using Pandora in the past and was relatively happy. Once I downloaded the Amazon Music with Prime Music I haven't even thought about my Pandora. The selection of music and the playlists plus the customizable playlists of Amazon Music is way better than any other music app I have encountered. I am super happy with this app and have put it on all my devices. Plus its free with my Amazon Prime subscription which was all that much better. Win Win. Can't go wrong with this App."
"January 30, 2017","Very poor app. As of 3-4 days ago the PC app started crashing constantly on launch and would not run. The ""blue"" interface is horrendous and extremely confusing. Amazon Music app on my Blackberry Z30 phone is taking 3-5 minutes to sync its content after every launch while there is NO new content to sync!!!! Why do I need to waste time for this useless operation? Why does it not let me listen to the music while it is ""syncing...""? Why does it not sync in the background? Frankly, the more I use Amazon software the stronger is my belief that it is on par with Microsoft's in terms of confusing UI, marketing-first approach and ""beta"" quality. Has anyone tried navigating Amazon's AWS portal to check the usage statistics? It's like a US Government web site - bloated, confusing, full of unneded noise."
"July 1, 2016","I HATE this app. I can't believe Amazon can't get something better designed. As far as maneuvering when using the app, it seems to be extremely sensitive....you can scroll down and all of a sudden what you were working with is gone, or hover over something for a second and you're another spot. My search bar doesn't work, it pulls up nothing, so I've been scrolling to find stuff and I have A LOT of music (see my complaint about scrolling). Much of my downloaded music is missing information and I have to manually fill it in otherwise music isn't where it should be...for instance, I had an album that was downloaded as 12 separate songs because there were no track numbers. I can't click and drag one album or artist to another area, so anything from, say, Joan Jett is separate from anything filed under Joan Jett & the Blackhearts...I have to manually change the info. Many albums have the wrong album cover art, sometimes even belonging to another artist, and some albums have no art whatsoever....there doesn't seem to be a way to copy an image from the internet, so I can't fill it in manually. The app is visually boring. I liked it so much better when you downloaded and it went straight to Media Player...Media Player is a far better app."
"June 28, 2017","Recently purchased a refurbished LG G3, and the app will not install (even though every other Amazon app works). Extremely disappointed...  [Update]  Had to install the Audible app, and update Kindle to get it to work. Odd work around that needs attention, but it works, and I have all my music back!"
"April 14, 2016","Unable to use on Android 6.0 Get error 45 Logged out of Amazon Uninstalled and reinstalled app Cleared cache and data Force close  EDIT: I figured out the issue was not Marshmallow or the phone. The issue was related to the old ""Amazon Appstore"" app. I logged out and deleted that app. Logged into Amazon Underground and all my apps are all there and reinstalled under the Underground app.  App works fine for me"
"March 27, 2017","If you are going to create a music app where you are selling music at least make sure the sound quality of the music sounds good. YouTube sounds much better. Sound a like my speakers are blowing out even on low volume. I have very good speakers"
"July 28, 2017","Nothing better than listening to my favorite music on Amazon, sitting on my deck, enjoying a single-malt scotch and a nice Cohiba! I usually cruise the jazz offerings but sometimes in the mood for other genres and Amazon keeps up with my mood."
"November 9, 2017","It wont install for me. The first time I tried I lost my signal and after that it would just not install. I tried going to my settings and uninstalling what was there and starting over but that didn't work,."
"June 16, 2014","While it is very convenient to have my Amazon music on my phone, this app still leaves much to be desired. The previous version of the app was very good, allowing me access to my Cloud music and the music store. As it was, I would have given it 4 stars. The reasons for the loss of one star were that 1) You can't store music on an SD card, and 2) You can't sync playlists from the device library to the Cloud. Otherwise, it was a very good music player.  However, with the new update, I am of a VERY different opinion. This new update is so full of glitches, it's almost unusable. The correct album art rarely shows, songs take FOREVER to load (even when they're on my device!), I can hit the 'skip' button a dozen times and the song won't change (although the song title text and album art will!). It also runs MUCH slower than the previous version. I'm quite certain it's not my device- I'm using a Galaxy SIII, on which all other apps just fine. I'm giving it two stars because the new layout is very nice, but that doesn't really count for much when the app itself hardly functions. Very disappointed, as releasing something this rough is very un-Amazon-like. They should have done more testing for bugs before releasing. Hopefully they will fix the bugs soon with a new update."
"July 31, 2017","Love the app. I like that I can turn off my screen and still listen on my Android. Also, I like that I can add a play list online with Prime which I think is easier on the computer. Can swipe down or hit the screen on for pause option. Nice!"
"June 6, 2017","works well. seems to have all the same options needed. I did notice my new ear phones shot up to full blast on it's own, but that may be my phone's fault. More testing to see if it is my phone being bad. Otherwise, great."
"March 27, 2014","Before I even checked out the native apps on my new phone, I went to the Amazon store to download this app (along with others previously purchased). I never got past the permissions screen- could not believe how intrusive they have made this app! So I didn't accept the terms, went back and read the reviews. There were enough bad reviews to give me serious pause, and after realizing the app would only store to phone internal memory (not the memory card), as well as the syncing issues, I have decided to give this app a pass and use the native music player preloaded on my phone. Sorry Amazon- I will miss being able to download music directly to my phone from Amazon purchases- but not enough to use your app."
"June 8, 2016","I use it all the time. It's my favorite music app. My only annoyance is that I can't find every song on the app, but it's not much of a bother."
"September 30, 2015","Adding songs to your playlists is a pain. Rather than the normal way of searching for a song and then adding it to your playlist you first have to add it to you library, then you have to go into your library and search for the song again, then you can choose to add it to your playlist. And the biggest problem is that there is no SD card support. Many phones have limited storage, but Amazon doesn't care about us people with older phones. It makes the app nearly worthless."
"February 21, 2016","I've been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now and also used Spotify for my music service. Last fall I canceled my Spotify subscription thinking Amazon's Prime Music service had to be at least decent enough considering I was already paying for it. Well, I'm wrong. My husband has already declared ""it sucks!"". But I don't listen as often and I have more ""mainstream"" tastes in music so I figured it should be good enough for me, but no. Here is a short list of why I don't like it; The avaiable music is nowhere near other top music services. The app is horrible. So much so that, even though it's essentially free since I pay for the shipping and video more than anything, I'd rather just listen to music I have already purchased than use the slow, difficult to use app. The app is quirky and constantly loses connection or repeatedly needs updated for a new version, or just plain won't recognize stuff I added to my playlists via the cloud. Plus, it seems like a lot of the songs that I want to listen to are ""re-recorded""versions by the artists that sound like a cover version of the song. I've not run across this with Spotify or Google Play. What's the deal with this scam?  In short, if you are not a regular music listener this might be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song (good luck if you can find it on Prime Music) . But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or working out, or want to listen while doing housework find something else."
"May 25, 2015","I just bought an album and went to download and while before I could just initialize the download directly into my computer files, NOW it is forcing me to download the Amazon Music App in order to access my songs. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong spot, but the options I once had before are gone. I don't care about whatever features are in this app, I don't need or want them. This takes up space in my hard drive and it's not like iTunes, Xbox Music (which is terrible by the way), or Windows Media Player aren't enough for me. I swear I am deleting this app as soon as it lets me pull my music out of it. To tell you the truth, this is such a pain in the butt that I probably won't download music from here anymore. 0 stars if I could!"
"September 3, 2017","I really thought all of these spacific thoughts and holly molly guacomole these others feel the same but write a quicky review... I'm telling u that itS Kinda something you gotta try with the website of choice. Its an update. So beware that I tested it as a viewing point. Amazon is pretty cool. I mean its such an easy app to drop it like its not the coolest thing to apply for. So next time complain to yourself and understand the actual website. It's not that hard to understand the concept. Apply or dont apply? For me I figured it out. 5***** rating."
"November 10, 2014","The app itself lags behind competitors in appearance of the UI, fluidity, song selection, and price. Some may say that ""it's included with prime so why complain?"", but at this point it's a better option to just pay for shipping normally if you need to and sign up for rhapsody or spotify (or save even more and don't use streaming services).  It's just unnecessary and costly. Honestly the only reason I cared for Prime was the shipping benefits, but when they decided to attach video (again not as good as netflix or hulu) and music to it and double the price, I cancelled my membership renewal. I would prefer a tier set up where you can elect which services you want, but i suspect that would reveal just how overpriced the services are and Amazon would lose too much money to keep them around."
"February 1, 2016","I am able to hear music selections from albums that I wouldn't have heard unless I used a torrent site and download the whole album. As far as I am concerned this is the best perk to Amazon prime.The best thing for me is when in NYC subway, my phone has no signal between stations, but yet Prime Music works 90% of the time. Meaning it will play the next song in the in your queue with no signal. I don't know how it does it but I love it."
"March 18, 2016","I have been a subscriber for years, and always fought through the hassles and headaches, but now I have hit my limit. Amazon Music says it can handle 250,000 songs, which is great for large libraries, so I uploaded tens of thousands of songs I had ripped and purchased over the years. Every CD I owned, every digital song I purchased, all of them of the last 40 years. This process took forever, but I thought it would be a great way to keep everything organized, and it worked for a while. Now the app does not work if you have more than 40,000 songs, so I am trying to get a local copy of MY music for home listening, and here is where the problem gets RIDICULOUS.  In order for me to get a copy of MY music I need to download the Amazon Music app, but the app does not work if you have a library larger than 40,000 songs. So I go to the website, and it is restricted to 200 songs at a time, and there is no stacking. In short it simply does not work for large files. So it will take me about a month to get all the songs, and this is with pretty constant attention. What I find amazing is importing was easy, but 200 songs per download means Amazon is flat out creating a barrier for customers to leave the service, and I find this unacceptable. I spend over $5,000 per month with Amazon and have for several years. I am an Amazon fan to say the least, and this is the first time Amazon has disappointed me in such a large way."
"August 20, 2017","App continually stops working. Sometimes never connects on network. Only works at home on wifi."
"June 9, 2017","Just writing a review to give feedback. When I open the app to listen to offline music but have poor reception, it takes forever to load. If I turn off my internet connection, it loads instantly. Obviously there's a ""phone home"" check going on, and if you delayed that or did it in parallel, the app would perform much better!  Otherwise, it's an ok app. I count Amazon music as a nice bonus to prime - certainly not why I got prime, but nice to have anyway"
"July 17, 2015","The Amazon Music app has become my app of choice for accessing the library of music on my phone and also music in my Amazon cloud storage. What I love about this app is it also provides access to TONS of Prime music, which is free to those with Prime accounts. I love the stations and playlists. I use them when working out or when I'm out for a bike ride. I select a station or playlist, and I'm on my way. Amazon selects a very nice collection of music to keep me company. The stations gear musical selections around the sensibility of the artist chosen. So the Jimi Hendrix station, for example, plays artists who are in the same general musical family as Hendrix. Amazon also tosses in a few Hendrix pieces too. There are hundreds--possibly thousands--of stations and playlists to choose from  My only criticism relates to getting a feel for how the app works. It took me a little while to figure out how to access the library on my phone and how to flip between my device music and my cloud music. Be careful of this! If you've saved your music to your phone and want to listen to it on your phone, be sure you've selected Device! If not, it'll go to the cloud to stream. You'll eat up data doing that. I've made this mistake a few times.  Very much recommended!"
"October 3, 2016","OK, have been a prime customer just about ever since I can remember. Joined Prime Music this year, took a while to get use to it over Pandora, but was fine until today. Went to my favorite play list and there were a bunch of songs that were Prime music and use to play all the time, and now the Prime logo is greyed out, and a prompt comes up with remove or buy. Truly a bait and switch tactic, that could almost be considered against the law. Second issue, last month I uploaded or I should say tried to upload discs out of my personal library. What a pain, they would only allow certain songs to be uploaded to my prime account, dialog box stated: incompatible format. Odd, they play on everything else I own. Most likely a licensing or royalty issue. Not at all happy now. I had a Stevie Ray Vaughn album that was all Prime Music, went to play today, all greyed out, they want me to buy now.Iit wasn't uploaded, don't own a copy. I will provide an update if I hear from them. I don't like surprises, don't think anyone does."
"June 15, 2014","Confusing, horrible interface. CANNOT UNINSTALL UPDATE once you apply it. Cloud/Device tabs are gone and how you find your existing music is a complete mystery. Impossible to tell whether you're purchasing music or getting it through Prime. I'm uninstalling this app completely. Amazon Prime music is definitely not ready for prime time. Thanks for pushing out a crappy app without giving me the ability to roll back to the old, much more elegant interface."
"June 24, 2015","I absolutely LOVE Amazon Prime Music! The choices are endless and 90% of the music I am looking for is included in my membership. I downloaded the app on my phone and have replaced my previous streaming music with it! I love how you can have your own library of you favorites, but choose a station to listen to when you feel like something different. They have channels to suit any mood and you can set up different playlists from your library. The best part, is when you hear a song that is streaming that you like, you just hit the plus sign and it adds it to your library and then provides you with alternatives you might like as well."
"June 26, 2014","I was really excited at first. As a Prime customer I was thrilled to see I had access to 1 million songs. And a lot of the songs on offer are right up my alley. The first day I added over 200 songs to my library.  But the Android App is now nearly unusable. It was great before but now is just horrible. I've been able to listen to maybe five of these songs in the last week as this app is so buggy. It won't load. It crashes frequently. The song pauses every few seconds due to poor, slow streaming quality. The app is also an enormous resource hog. It takes up most of the RAM and drains the battery. My phone can no longer achieve a full charge when plugged into the wall for a few hours and drains to nothing in two hours with minimal or no use at all. I love that it remains ""running"" when it doesn't even work.  The desktop program is tolerable. It was annoying trying to install flash in chrome and took a long time to set it up but I can live with that. I cannot tolerate the phone app. If things don't improve soon I will uninstall it and will also not renew my Prime Membership."
"June 28, 2016","Music part works fine, but I do not like the ""Turn on Wi-Fi"" permission. Don't need it, don't want it, can't see a valid reason for it. Uninstalled after I noticed my battery level dropping for no reason. My bad, I didn't read the permissions list."
"April 5, 2015","I use this app on my Nexus 7--a Google product--and it doesn't allow me to listen to the Amazon Prime Stations. Not sure this is by spiteful design or simple indifference, but it greatly limits it usefulness to me. IIRC, it wouldn't install at all on my Coolpad Quattro cellular, further making it of little use. Works okay on my various PCs, where I also utilize strong competitors such as Pandora, Spotify, or Slacker. I would have given it only 2 stars except I do like the categorical choices for the stations (when I can see them!)."
"March 11, 2015","I never even finished installing this bit of spyware, there's no reason they need access to my browser history or my bookmarks. I pay enough for prime and my music that Amazon doesn't need to be trying to make money from my private info, too. If they ever trim the list down to the things they actually need, I may try again. But as we all know, big companies don't care at all about our privacy or the fact that we're human beings, not ""consumers"", so that won't happen. If you love the idea of this company keeping track of every little thing you do, then go ahead and install it!   Since I cannot use music purchased through Amazon the way I wish, I really need to rethink where I'm spending my money. Very disappointed in Amazon as a whole, my privacy matters."
"December 13, 2012","I like the Amazon MP3 music player and use it daily. It is able to access both the SD card on my phone and the cloud player. Easy interface to use and browse your music.  My only gripe is that it puts a delay between tracks even when there isn't one on the original album. I like to listen to a lot of Frank Zappa and and other classical music (yes, I said Frank Zappa and classical music in the same sentence!) and many of the tracks are supposed to blend from one into the next without a pause. Itunes and Windows media player can do this, Amazon MP3 player should be able to do it as well. Try listening to Wagner:""The Ring Without Words"" and the gaps between sections will drive you nuts. I would give this a 5 star rating if they would fix that problem.  UPDATE 1/27/14 - Amazon has updated the MP3 player since I wrote this review. Now, the player does not insert the delay between tracks and the songs flow smoothly from one to the other. I can now listen to my Zappa, Beethoven and Wagner as they were meant to be heard - uninterrupted! Highly recommended."
"January 1, 2017","DISAPPEARING CONTROLS ?!#? Need I say more? How idiotic. Believe it or not this is not the only Windows program or app I use. Having controls at the top (iTunes), some at the bottom (Amazon), etc. and then have them disappear so I have to hunt for them by moving the mouse around the screen every time I want to pause, or skip, or ... WHAT IS THE POINT? (At least I found a way to turn off the disappearing scroll bar in Microsoft Word. One down, one-hundred to go). Please, someone in Development or Design tell me what the benefit is of using disappearing controls?"
"August 3, 2015","This is one of the worst apps on the planet. It lets you buy, but then won't let you use your media card and will fill up your device over and over, even after you move the files. It's a resource hog as one reviewer mentioned, but you don't have a choice if you want to buy on Amazon with your phone. It sucks, but you may have to install, use, uninstall like I have."
"January 28, 2017","This is by far the best music product for listening during exercise, at home while surfing the web and while driving the auto. Provides pure enjoyment during activities. Easy to navigate with supper music choices and radio stations add free with Prime. The best deal in the industry that I can see. Don't think you will be disappointed."
"February 19, 2016","My newest addiction is amazon prime music. I use the app primarily on my phone. I love the pre-made playlists. Very easy for an indecisive music fan. Just pick what type of music I'm in the mood for, or a band I like, and Amazon does the rest. I stream this in the car, in the office, and in the gym. Tons of free music available through prime. No complaints from me. I've tried Milk music, Pandora, and other similar apps. I like Amazon music the best."
"April 4, 2017","I used to have another subscription for music. I tried Amazon, but back then (several years ago) there wasn't as much of a selection of my type of music. Now, Amazon Music is all I listen too and few of my family members as well! I really have no complaints and literally use this 365 days a year."
"July 14, 2017","Doesn't work on the echo dot, as the dot can't find an internet connection on the best internet available."
"May 3, 2011","I love the Cloud Drive and Cloud Player. Frankly I had this app frozen on my rooted Droid 2 until Amazon came out with Cloud Player. Now I have a ton of music online and use this player almost exclusively.  The main complaint I have is that the Player doesnt remember where I was the last time I ran it. This is a big issue when trying to listen to audio books. Everytime I close the program for a second (hit the home key or switch tasks) I have to remember where I was in the current track. And then when I reopen I (many times) have to scroll to find my album, the tack then click cose to where I was. It is just too hard. Save the last location and I give this a 5 star.  UPDATE: When Amazon enacted their limits to songs/ storage or purchase this year I deleted it. Storage is so very cheap now (especially for Amazon, who doesn't have to actually store each song, but only a marker saying we have access to the song) and there are so many competitors (Google Play Music, for instance) I can't justify using this app. I downloaded all my songs (which took almost a day!) then deleted. You've lost me, Amazon MP3, until you give back unlimited storage."
"February 14, 2013","I hate to downrate the app to two stars. Overall, the app is a nice player. Unfortunately, the app forces you to save to the phones (Galaxy3)internal SD card which in my phone does not have sufficient room for my music. The app needs a way to select from the various SD stores in the phone. At this time you have two options, root the phone and remap the phones internal SD storage location or copy the music files to the external SD (which breaks playlists).  If Amazon were to fix that one problem I would re-rate the app to 5 stars."
"April 9, 2017","Prior versions of this app were uninspired but functional. The current version is so poorly designed as to be nonfunctional. I've moved back to iTunes. Near as I can make out, the net effect of this app - if not the strategic intent - to make using this app to access downloaded and owned music so inconvenient that you just go to Amazon Unlimited streaming instead."
"July 19, 2014","Amazon Music with Prime Music is the best application I have ever seen. Customers receive this application as part of their prime membership. The benefits of this program are worth the price of a prime membership. You can listen to almost every artist for free. The albums and playlists that are free have the prime banner on them and show the price as $0.00. I mention this because you want to be careful as the app sneaks in some suggested albums that cost money. Customers can listen to music ad free!!!! Goodbye to other music apps that have annoying commercials. What are you waiting for? Download Amazon Music with Prime Music today!"
"July 27, 2016","have alexa and I am always playing amazon stations and music on her love it nice to have when doing work around the house. Found this when I got a pair of blue tooth ear buds and I wanted to play music when I go to gym. Have not used music in a very long time when working out forgot how much easier it is to do. Love this because of all the radio different stations and individual playlist that you can make it is fantastic.Sure wish I would have done this sooner. Thanks Amazon"
"November 23, 2016","It is a terribly complicated way to upload and categorize music. If you upload your own music it uses the Artists name as the main indentifier and if there are multiple artists it creates an album for each of them instead of seeing the album as a whole. You can edit but the app is not user friendly in that it requires multiple steps each time you edit an album. Unlike iTunes you cannot edit the entire album information all at one time. It requires you to do that song by song. Terrible. I am not a fan of iTunes but I find it more user friendly then Amazon music."
"December 6, 2016","***THE WORST MUSIC SOFTWARE***  1. Doesn't play the majority of the songs I've uploaded. 2. Sometimes replaces album art with incorrect ones. 3. Sometimes deletes lyrics from various songs (not really relevant since the Amazon Music Player doesn't display lyrics, unless that feature is enabled and then you're left with songs without lyrics)  Amazon refuses to play most of my songs that were uploaded to the cloud. These are original mp3 or m4a files. I don't understand what the problem is. Some play, some don't. Why?  I did find a workaround that involves uploading, downloading, and then uploading again. That's right: upload the song, then download it back to your computer, delete the original uploaded song from Amazon's cloud server, and then re-upload the downloaded song. It appears that certain things are delete from the original uploaded, such as lyrics. Maybe Amazon doesn't like certain lyrics? Who knows!!!"
"October 19, 2015","As far as the apps for Prime Music, the latest Windows version, latest Android/Chrome versions, and now MacOS version all all improved but still not as full-featured and easy to use as they should be. There is no music enhancement such as any kind of editor or EQ. I'd like to see a sophisticated sound normalization and EQ option if possible. The Prime Music uploading app (admittedly a separate app that goes with this one and should actually be rolled into this one) does seem in immediate need of a major refresh as it seems long-winded and clunky to use. It should be much more user-friendly plainly speaking. As for the Prime Music Service itself, well because it's free as a Prime member I'm happy for anything that adds value that I'd actually use and benefit from. That said, Prime Music has a long way to go to be an actual music service anyone would want enough to pay for. Yep, if you're paying your going to want Spotify, Tidal, or Pandora. With these services you don't request to listen to Badfinger and get some nameless cover band ""re-recording"" the song which even if you were four or five cocktails in would sound ridiculous compared to the real song. This is a real serious fault of Prime Music and I'm shocked it's even within acceptable legal limits, i.e. the song says it's ""Day After Day"" by Badfinger but it sounds like an attempt (and often a poor one) to sound like Badfinger...So, how can these songs be represented as THE song by THE band??? Here's the bottom line: If Amazon Prime Music is going to be anything other than a free music service (which Amazon hopes keeps Prime customers re-upping due to value) Amazon is going to have to really get access to a VERY LARGE music catalog and do away with the ""bait and switch"" SOUNDS BAD RE-RECORDINGS. And speaking of sound, the fidelity of actual sources are sometimes noticeably not the best (it's likely the source and not the streaming quality itself), I think Amazon needs to raise the fidelity a noticeable notch too.  I've been critical because I do like the fact I can create a playlist of mostly free songs in the cloud. They can be ones Amazon offers as part of Prime as well as my purchases and uploads. This is the best part and I like it. If Amazon will put some of it's muscle and money behind this service it will be not only for current Prime members but will bring an avalanche of new Prime customers."
"October 18, 2014","At first was excited to find this app to stream my Amazon music library on my mac. That excitement didn't last long. Takes SO long just to navigate through music. Search is slow and then if you do find the artist/song you're looking for it displays the album art next to it, NOT the one you selected. Beyond that, takes FOREVER just to play a song. Mostly takes up CPU and spins. I've got a super fast internet connection too, so that's not it.  Sadly I had to go back to the browser just to play my library, and that user interface is even more clunky. And JUST FINDING MY MUSIC LIBRARY was nearly impossible. Easy to find Prime video, prime music, but SO HARD to find my own music I own.  If performance for this app ever did get fixed, it sure would be cool to have an Android app to access and play my library like a remote control. Ever cooler to have an iTunes-like visualizer."
"July 2, 2017","Amazing and fun app to use to discover some new music. I feel like there is still too much crude AI use in selecting music however, and the mediocre music selection/dj'ing can dull the experience."
"August 12, 2015","I love this service. It could use some tweaking as far as getting to know my tastes, but I think maybe I need to use it more. The only reason it's not 5 star is because they don't have a whole lot of new using available to listen to for Prime memebers. Otherwise in an are where I have internet, the service works seamlessly and the sound is pretty good."
"February 9, 2016","First: This works fine on my computer, and I like it.  Second, there is a very big ""but"": not only was it gobbling half my battery life with the phone app - all while not being used - that it doesn't do what it must do if it's a phone app. Namely, work on my wifi. I thought that suddenly my the battery on my phone must be weakening. It is not.  In order to download the music that belongs to you or use the player services it provides, you have to allow it to get on your phone's internet . It refuses to use wifi. This is bizarre, but what the hey. I downloaded my purchases and thought everything was fine. Come to find out, I'd used 1GB of data that I didn't even know about. Now, what is that? Then I got busy and forgot to look into it. I haven't used the player in the last week, and now my phone service is notifying me that I've used ANOTHER 1 GB of data!?! What in the world is it doing to use that much. Lucky for me I have a big plan, or I'd be paying now.  Amazing. Update: I logged out to stop it (there is no off button and you can't get it to leave your notifications or stand down otherwise), and now it's got a pop up asking me to log in that you can't get out of by pressing the back button. Amazon can forget it. I'm not logging in and out when I want to play music."
"August 24, 2015","This app was never very functional but with the latest update it became unusable. I have 1 account I use for apps and a different account I use with a prime membership. All worked well for me prior to single sign on. When Amazon introduced single sign on, instead of making things easier they made everything more complicated and broke things in the process! Initial, after installing the Amazon app store you could sign in using a different user after downloading and installing Prime Music. Trying to sign in with a different user using the Amazon store app did not work. No things are reversed. Sign in with a different user works with the Amazon store app but no longer works with the Prime music app. Amazon, do us all a favor, get rid of your broken implementation of &#34;single sign on&#34; please!!!"
"May 30, 2017","I am trying to understand the logic behind this ""free music"" app marketed to people who already pay you a $100 per year. Are you completely unaware that we can already stream music for free elsewhere without a subscription of any kind? ""Stored on a cloud"" simply means ""we control all of your access to music you purchased"". I am not going to renew our Prime subscription next year. So far our is just a gateway to additional monthly fees."
"November 9, 2017","Though I like the concept of Amazon music with prime, this app leaves a bit to be desired. Specifically it is really slow. I have around 3000 songs on my Galaxy S7. It can take upwards of a minute to change screens. Once I have reached the album, playlist or artist I am searching for, it plays just fine."
"July 8, 2016","I really like Amazon Music. I've been using it for about 6 months and it's finally starting to become a viable replacement for Spotify and Pandora and whatnot. It doesn't have quite the music selection as its competitors, but it has enough to keep me happy.  At first there were some design flaws that made things a bit confusing, but they've been constantly making small adjustments that have made the whole experience very simple to use.  Also, I'm really happy they've been adding more classic Prog Rock, like Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Yes and some of the newer stuff like Between the Buried and Me, Opeth, The Mars Volta. Can't wait to see more of that and other Prog Rock.The selection keeps getting better every week.  One thing I'd really like to see is a higher bit rate option. I think it'd be a really nice feature, although the music does sound pretty decent as is. Also gapless playback, if possible. With alot of prog, songs weren't designed to have a pause between songs; they just keep playing."
"November 18, 2015","Amazon needs to do some serious fixing on their digital media. I tried music for the first time after getting a prompt that im only using 2 services What happens with my first experience? ""Try again Later"" Yes thats what I wanted to see. Same applies to movies. Took two attempts and at least a half hour to get a movie to play. Last time I tried to watch a movie it was telling me I couldnt watch it in HD, ""not enough bandwidth"" I have 60 meg bandwidth router 10 ft from TV. Those services are terrible. Amazon. Renewal Im thinking not."
"October 5, 2017","I was skeptical of this application and just what music I could get as an Amazon Prime member. I was pleasantly surprised at all the well thought out features and the wide selection of music from all genres . I have an MP3 player and I plan to load it with music from my play lists in Amazon Music. For us Baby Boomers, we can listen to and enjoy all the legendary mucic of our time."
"January 3, 2016","What an awesome benefit of being a Prime member! Music creates a time line through our lives. Hearing certain songs take you back to great times, so much so, that you feel through association that you are there.  Getting around the Amazon Music app is very easy and intuitive. If you invest a little time, you can create a great playlist of songs that you love. Amazon....Thanks for including this with the Prime membership!"
"November 13, 2016","I'm fairly computer literate and this is a painful application/service to use. This is especially true if you have a large library to upload to the cloud. I'm talking weeks of babysitting this thing to get them there.  Also, the app is very slow to respond when scrolling around in My Library. There should be a local index so this doesn't happen. Of course, the Store browsing works reasonably well since they only have tiny web pages (a couple of screens long).  This service is a valuable component to the Alexa universe. Pleeeeeze, Get it right. It honestly seems like Amazon really doesn't want you to use your music you already own, in favor of a streaming service. It may be fine for some, but personally, I don't want Amazon feeding me music via streaming. I want MY music. Think about this.... What if your parents told you what was popular and you had to stream from that."
"September 21, 2015","The good: No ads Large selection overall Doesn't cut off the last 15 seconds of music (an issue Pandora has never bothered to fix)  The bad: Some genres are rather sparse (in particular heavy metal and alternative) pausing songs for more than a couple of minutes causes the app to replay the song from scratch or shut down altogether The search function really needs some work. I have had better luck searching in my browser than I have in the app from my phone.  In total, this has become the music app of choice for me."
"July 1, 2016","I have used other options for my music. Amazon music is the best so far! I love that I get digital copies of my purchases immediately and can enjoy the music before I recieve my actual CD. I live that with Prime I can share my Amazon options with my household!! I just love Amazon! I used to be an eBay customer but Prime offers so many benefits that the competition can't compare. Having Amazon music on top of all the other great Amazon products just makes it sweeter!"
"May 23, 2017","This app is great when it works. However, in the last few months it is constantly freezing after playing only a few songs (offline) and recently in the last few weeks, it will either not launch my library or it will hang up before a song loads to start playing. It is extremely frustrating and I would not consider this app or service when deciding to purchase Amazon Prime, because it is so unreliable. If this was a free service, I would expect some issues occasionally. I expect so much better from Amazon. Maybe Wal-Mart or one of the other competitors that Amazon used to dominate will jump in and make an app that just simply works."
"July 10, 2016","It's a waste of time out of the gate on my android phone. I bought a bluetooth headset to listen to podcasts while I'm mowing the lawn.  The podcast is already on my phone.  I open Amazon music, which is supposed to play music on the device and voila, it does. It plays through the speaker on the device.  I attach the headset and, uh, no. No audio. I can see it playing, I can hear the volume go up and down as it makes a ding each time I adjust the volume.  I screw around and waste 20 minutes pairing and unpairing, looking at settings, nothing fixes it so I toss it on the bed and mow my lawn with nothing but the voices in my head to occupy my time.  I come back in and install BlackPlayer. It works flawlessly out of the box.  Amazon how how much money to blow on development and you can't stream audio to a bluetooth headset in 2016?  Here's some advice. My data will never live in your cloud. Stop designing poor apps thinking it will."
"July 21, 2017","Awesome, better than any music streaming I have used to date on any platform. Lets you listen to individual songs, or stations, and has the thumbs up/down feature also. Seriously the best one I have used. And I tried a bunch."
"August 27, 2015","Having Amazon Prime now I decided to check out the music. The playlists are awesome! I am so happy to tap a list and get to working now rather than search for a station on another app that is playing something good. I can choose a Playlist that I like and the majority of the music is still what I like. I do wish it could do a predictive play from previously played and/or downloaded songs. As long as I am connected to wifi the app plays smoothly."
"March 2, 2017","I am supposed to be able to hear a bunch of it for free, but its difficult to get around in or even to set a group of songs to play one after the other so I can get work done & not come back every 3 to 4 minutes to put on the next song."
"September 26, 2017","Easy to use, large variety of genres and artists make Amazon Music worth it. Ability to download is also a plus. I wish artists/songs didn't disappear at random but they are replaced by new ones so it's a bit of a wash. Overall a thumbs up."
"September 19, 2016","I really do like this app. I personally find it simple to use although some might find it a bit cumbersome. I do like the fact that I can choose between my personal library and the Amazon Prime library. The only thing I wish were different is the fact that there are some songs and artists I can absolutely not find. This is probably due to song/album/artist rights and more of an artists choice than an Amazon issue, but it's still a bummer."
"July 5, 2015","I've used several electronic streaming TV and music services and Amazon by far blows them ALL out of the water. I rarely have trouble with streaming/buffering issues and I've downloaded it on my computers and mobile phone. The ability to setup playlists for various genres or family members is awesome and I plan on using this for my outdoor speaker system that I also plan to purchase on Amazon. Prime membership is worth every dime with all of the features you receive including the streaming music service. Amazon is my ""go to"" place when it comes to online shopping and entertainment. A+++++"
"March 2, 2017","It was great until the most recent update. Using it was always difficult but the access to the library of albums and music was fantastic, now it is not. I was enjoying listening to albums and songs, creating more playlists, etc. and now it doesn't provide any entertainment unless I subscribe monthly. I am going back to my IPOD."
"June 21, 2016","Uninstalled. It just removes music that you bought through them, the cloud storage is a joke as it is constantly rescanning, songs bought and saved to my sd card don't show up or just won't play. The prime music is not a good deal, as the songs are just removed with no warning (kills whatever Playlist it lives in with it). I play games, videos and other Internet intensive apps with no issue. Amazon plays two songs from MY device and still manages to skip and refuse to play. Utter garbage. No customer support either. Just one maddening phone call after another that translates to 'got your money, sucka!' Officially done."
"September 29, 2015","Out of all of the different music playing apps that I have had on my phone, I like this one the best. It's really easy to search for songs and load them to my playlist. It's easy to switch between my different playlists. Additionally, almost every cd that I have purchased (from Amazon) was automatically added to my collection of music, as an added surprise. There are also Amazon Station and cloud storage but I have not tried those quite yet."
"October 13, 2016","Forced new update is a complete disaster. Horrible interface that take more time/work to get anything done. Tons of music I never uploaded to the app is now there that I have to go through to make my playlists. I love that if I contact Amazon to complain and ask to go back to the old app their only answer is that you can't once you've installed it. That's nice except for I didn't install it. I'll have to see if I can get my music onto my echo with some other program or through it in the trash where it belongs now that this garbage has been forced on me."
"July 5, 2017","I know prime doesn't charge enough for everything that comes with It! I appreciate the generosity tremendously and try to take advantage of all that prime offers whenever possible!"
"December 11, 2015","Every morning I start my day choosing whether to download new music, play my playlist, or listening to a channel. Throughout the day, I know that no matter what I am planning on doing, there is music that fits, whether Ska, Classic, Rock, Pop, Country, everything in one place. I've had different online music programs, some I pay for, some free, and this one is the very best that I have come across.I can listen across all my devices without having to make a new playlist each and every time just by signing into my account."
"June 27, 2014","The app in its former life as the MP3 app was very good - at least 4 stars. The new version is only worth 1 star. What is most annoying is that whenever I startup the app it spams me with a full screen ad for Prime music with no obvious way to get to my music. I thought this trick was reserved for malware. I finally discovered that pushing the back ""button"" twice quickly on my device I could get to my music. This is not how an app which is supposed to stream music I pay for (either by purchasing it or by subscribing to prime) is supposed to behave. I really wish there was an alternative app."
"February 2, 2017","I used to love Amazon Music and would recommend it to everyone; not anymore.This app has become so buggy it's almost unusable. It will just stay running in the background for hours despite closing it multiple times.  With Android Auto... OH My GOD it's awful! I can only access Recently Played, Recommended Stations, and a couple of other avenues that Amazon tries to force feed me. I have no way to browse the THOUSANDS of songs I purchased THROUGH AMAZON. I can't access My Playlists, nothing. If I unplug the phone, go to the playlist, artist, or song I want and then start playing it, I can then plug it into my car and listen to that, and ONLY that selection. Obviously, that's not ideal when you're trying to drive.  I just want to be able to play all the songs on my phone in my car, why is that too much to ask?"
"August 27, 2016","Tried it out for a couple of weeks and it was great i can stream all my purchased tracks with great quality, But the main problem i had was when i uploaded some of my music it changed all of the cover art and i could not change it back i tried everything i could so that it didn't but it kept doing it so i just stopped using it that was the deal breaker for me."
"September 30, 2017","AMAZON CLOSED ACCT ON IRMA VICTIM FOR BEING 14 DAYS LATE ON $45 DUE TO POWER LOSS NO WAY TO PICK UP OR DEPOSIT PAY CHECK SHAME ON YOU AMAZON. IRMA VICTIMS HAD NO POWER IN THEIR AREA TO DO ANY BANKING AT THE BANKS OR ONLINE SINCE NO POWER, NO INTERNET AND NO CELL TOWERS/SERVICE. WORKPLACES WERE CLOSED, BANKS HAD NO POWER, AND AMAZON IS THE ONLY, ONLY, ONLY COMPANY THAT REFUSED TO HELP IRMA VICTIMS BY OFFERING A COURTESY DUE TO BEING IN THE DISASTER AREA."
"January 8, 2017","My main music source personally and when at work teaching. Play my music when I want to, with no interruptions or commercials. Took the place of my spotify."
"April 2, 2017","They really need to start listening to customer suggestions. My personal music that I uploaded into my cloud (and pay $25 a year to do so) has half the songs not playing correctly. The app doesn't respond well on the Fire Stick, and on my car iPod (a 5th gen), the app is so slow and buggy, and my personal uploads play maybe 40% of the time. Also, WHY can't we sort out playlist music alphabetically!? I am seriously considering a massive switch from Amazon Digital services!"
"January 7, 2014","I have a Galaxy Note 3, and no matter what I did I could not get this app to properly install, nor work. At one point I got the widget installed, but when I would touch the widget all that would happen would be that a grey screen flashes and then you're right back to where you started. When installing other apps, like from the Play Store, after the installation there are usually two buttons presented; ""open"" and ""uninstall"". With this app, however, those buttons are ghosted over so you can't open the app even if you wanted to. No luck finding it in the applications folder either.. I'm so disappointed because I have so much music hosted on Amazon, but can't even get it to play when i really need it to."
"July 8, 2017","Difficult to use music that you purchased with other apps on your devices. I have wasted so much time trying to download my songs on my device and not just within this app."
"October 18, 2016","So far I am satisfied with the Amazon music app. I just signed up for prime. I was able to find all the music I love. I also downloaded them for offline play. It's great being able to listen to your favorite songs without using mobile data when you aren't on wifi."
"June 1, 2017","Have you listened to the All 90's station on this app? They lied! It's not ALL 90's it's basically 90's Alternative with little bits and pieces of other genres sprinkled in. And I swear I hear the same songs over and over and over and over and over again. It even gets to the point where I'm not even surprised anymore. When I first started listening to this station, I would hear songs and think, ""Wow, I haven't heard this in a while"". Now, they seem to play the same 10-20 songs, and I think, ""Oh, this again."". Come on now! If you're going to call this station ""All 90's"", play ALL 90's music."
"January 1, 2017","Ok so I've used another music app for a long time. Things that could use some adjusting... Opening the app after closing you can't go to the list you were just listening to. There is no ""play next option"" you have to physically move it which can get crazy trying to scroll up and down. I want to be able to see main controls (play, skip, pause, etc) from any screen, while I am browsing for other music. Get these right and I could completely switch."
"March 14, 2015","Great way to listen to music you want to hear. You add music to your library and listen to it. It seems to be a web player like Pandora, but unlike Pandora, it's not a radio player. It looks like there's a way to pre-load songs if you go on a trip, which is great. I will continue to check it out. Best of all there seems to be a random button for all songs in your library without creating a playlist. You have no idea how many devs overlook that feature in music players. It's a deal breaker for me not to have that option."
"May 22, 2017","apparently is not designed for the kindle fire tablet!"
"April 29, 2017","It sucks it doesn't easily adapt the Amazon library into other music libraries you have so you have to switch out if the one library to listen to your other music stored in your device"
"July 5, 2015","The interface it not the easiest to navigate and makes it difficult to perform actions on songs/albums while actively playing music. The process of having to first find a song in the Amazon library, then figure out if it is a Prime music track or only available for additional fee, and finally having to move the song from the Amazon library to your library before being able to play the entire thing is tedious. I should be able to have a standing filter that only shows music I don’t need to pay extra for and I should be able to stream whatever is presented without having to first add it to some other library. The radio feature is limited to preset stations. There is no continuous playlist option to supplement the active playlist with a radio selection based on the most recent playlist selection.  As far as glitches: When you are lucky enough to find the song you want, and have it be part of the Prime offering, then you have the issue of actually playing the track. Often when trying to add a new song to my library it will indicate it has been added, but then when I go to play the song nothing happens. Sometimes the song will play after a minute or two, but other times you have to exit the application completely and relaunch it to get the new songs to play. This is very frustrating when you simply want to listen to a new song!  And the good stuff: Once you start to play a track there are no hiccups in the audio output. You’d think this would go without saying, but a lot of the steaming services that have web based players don’t seem to be able to get this right, including Spotify and Google Music. Having an application on the desktop is one way to assure smooth playback, although some services seem to be able to make good web players that can do this too. Also, the quality of the recordings sounds good to me, with no loss of quality that I could readily notice due to the applied compression."
"November 3, 2016","CRASH - CRASH - CRASH.  Every time I try to upload new music the darn thing just crashes. This is not the first time Amazon has used their customers to beta test a new product before it is ready for Prime time. When they do that I start mistaking them for Apple Music. I don't know where to even get help or who to e-mail to register a complaint. Grrrrrrrr."
"June 9, 2015","I really am trying to like this service, but it's always crapping out on me. It will start playing a track, but with out any audio. Then the audio *might* come on, but when it goes to the next track – if it does at all – it's often silent again. Or, it may happily play several tracks, and then crap out again. Needless to say, this ""free"" service for Prime members is as they say, what you pay for. I'm going to give Apply Music a try when it's released."
"July 26, 2017","The idea of having a mobile app is to be able to use it on the go. This was something that overlook completely by the developer. The UL is way too complex. You should be able to click the app icon and within one or two taps be able to play your music. NO, you have to scroll down past the banner ad on the home page just to realize that what you were just listening to on your desktop is not there. Okay lets try the recent button,..Nope not that one. wait the added tab? No.. OK back to home screen, No, I don't know ! I'll close the app and listen to radio or CD on the drive home. Now if you have the time and are willing to spend it exploring this app; it does have all the features of the the desktop version and is quit robust, again not very mobile friendly ."
"June 15, 2014","This app is compatible with neither my Kindle Fire nor my Android phone. An Amazon app that doesn't even work with a nearly new Amazon device? Inexcusable."
"November 3, 2016","THIS APP HAS PROBLEMS WITH THE MOTO G PHONES AND MARSHMALLOW 6.01. I GET AN ERROR #45 WHEN ATTEMPTING TO USE. I HAVE LOGGED OUT OF ALL MY AMAZON APPS, SET APP PRIVILEGES TO ALL, CLEARED DATA CACHE, FORCED START AND NOTHING WORKS. PLEASE SUPPORT ANDROID PHONES! I WAS ON TECH SUPPORT FOR AN HOUR AND REPS WERE NOT ABLE TO HELP."
"October 17, 2016","I have been looking for an application that allows me to listen to ""stations"" that are customized by my likes and dislikes as well as being able to play music stored on my device. The Amazon Music applications does both of these things; furthermore there are no advertisements and unlimited skips (contrasted to pandora). This app is amazing."
"May 31, 2014","Phone: Nexus 5, 32GB.  1) 99% of the time, I use Amazon MP3 to play my Amazon Cloud songs. I generally list items by Album. Well, when I finish listening to an album, go back to the album list and try to play another, it NEVER works. It just hangs. So every time I'm done with an album, I have to completely close and re-open the program. This is extremely frustrating, especially when listening to complilations because....  2) Compilations are not grouped under one album. Every single song lists the exact same album name, yet Amazon MP3 creates a separate album for every artist. So you can't just click on an comp and let it play. You have to go back and choose a new song every time, which is maddening when you consider problem #1 above. I'm guessing Amazon would respond that there's something in the metadata that doesn't flag it as a comp, but come on. If I'm in album view, just combine the albums with the same name."
