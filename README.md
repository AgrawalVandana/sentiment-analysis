# sentiment-analysis-nlp
## Summary
In this project I explored how we can make sense of text data by understanding the polarity (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
of emotions or sentiments conveyed in text reviews of music app of Amazon, Spotify and Pandora. During the cursury scan of review dataset i found that there were many instances in the reveiw where emoticons were used.This is new normal of today's world, we do use emoticons to convey our feelings.Emoticon analysis provides a good tool for understanding the sentiment when texts are amibious, hence I have decided to explore emotion analysis.Finally once the polarity of each review is extracted. I have categorized the reviews in different contexual bucket(Aspects), for example for a music app its cost,song-collection, stability etc.are some of the most imporatnt attribute user look for while deciding to buy.Reviews aspect in which its polarity falls gives a collective user feedback about that aspect. For example Pandora app user feel very expensive application to buy.
